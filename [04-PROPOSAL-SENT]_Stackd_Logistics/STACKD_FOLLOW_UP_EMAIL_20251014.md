## Email Body

Hi Landon,

Following up on our recent discussions, I've completed a comprehensive analysis of Stackd Logistics' shipping data using FirstMile's Xparcel rates. The results show **$41,773 in annual savings (9.5%)** on your DHL eCommerce ground volume.

### Key Findings:

**Select Network Performance (Major Metros)**
- **15.7% savings** on 53% of your volume shipping to CA, TX, FL, NY, WA
- These are your highest-volume destinations where FirstMile's metro injection points deliver maximum value
- 4,487 packages/month addressable with superior economics

**National Network (All Other States)**
- **2.7% savings** on remaining 47% of volume
- Still cost-competitive while maintaining nationwide coverage
- 3,931 packages/month with reliable service

**Honest Assessment Approach**
I've broken down exactly where FirstMile excels (Select Network metros) and where we're competitive but not dominant (National Network). This transparency helps you make an informed decision and sets realistic expectations.

**What We Excluded**
Your UPS 2nd Day Air volume is **not included** in this analysis. That's a guaranteed service, while Xparcel is non-guaranteed ground. We're competing against your DHL eCommerce ground spend where we can deliver real value.

**Simplified Implementation**
- Your ShipHero integration is **already connected** - no additional platform work needed
- We just need to create FirstMile credentials during account setup (7-10 days from form submission)
- No pilot phase required - we can go straight to performance review cadence

### Total Opportunity:
- **8,418 packages/month** addressable volume
- **$41,773 annual savings** at current volume
- **9.5% overall savings** vs DHL baseline

### Next Step:

Let's schedule a **30-minute call this week** to walk through the attached Excel analysis together. I can answer any questions about the network breakdown, implementation timeline, or performance expectations.

**What works for you?**
- Tuesday 10/15: 10 AM or 2 PM MST
- Wednesday 10/16: 9 AM or 3 PM MST
- Thursday 10/17: 11 AM or 1 PM MST

The full analysis is attached with detailed breakdowns across 6 tabs:
1. Executive Summary
2. FirstMile Advantages (dynamic routing, audit queue, unified support)
3. Weight Analysis (your lightweight profile)
4. Zone Analysis (regional vs cross-country split)
5. Rate Comparison (package-by-package DHL vs FirstMile)
6. Implementation Plan (4-phase timeline)

Looking forward to connecting this week.

Best regards,
**Brett Walker**
FirstMile

## Key Talking Points (If Call Happens)

1. **Select Network Advantage:**
   - "Your top 5 states (CA, TX, FL, NY, WA) represent 53% of volume - perfect fit for our Select Network injection points"
   - "15.7% savings in these metros vs 9.5% blended average"

2. **Honest Positioning:**
   - "National Network at 2.7% savings isn't a huge win, but it maintains consistency across your entire fulfillment footprint"
   - "We're not trying to oversell - just showing you where FirstMile delivers real value"

3. **Implementation Simplicity:**
   - "ShipHero already connected means we're 80% there"
   - "7-10 days from paperwork to first shipments"
   - "Weekly TouchBase meetings first month, then bi-monthly check-ins"

4. **Scope Clarity:**
   - "Intentionally excluded UPS 2nd Day Air - that's a guaranteed product we can't match with non-guaranteed Xparcel"
   - "Focused on your DHL ground volume where we can compete directly"

5. **Performance Expectations:**
   - "3-8 day SLA for Xparcel Ground"
   - "Dynamic routing optimizes for both speed and cost"
   - "Audit Queue prevents billing errors before invoice hits your AP"
