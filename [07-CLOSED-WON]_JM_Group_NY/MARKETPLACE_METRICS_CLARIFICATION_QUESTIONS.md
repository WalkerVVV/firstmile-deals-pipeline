## ‚ùì CRITICAL QUESTIONS I NEED ANSWERED

### 1. Amazon Late Shipment Rate (1.44%)

**Question**: How does Amazon define "Late Shipment"?

**What I need to know**:
- Is this based on **ship date vs. promised ship date**?
- Or is this based on **delivery date vs. promised delivery date**?
- What is the **promised ship date** typically? (Same day? Next day? 2 days after order?)
- Does the promise vary by SKU, fulfillment method, or Prime status?

**Why this matters**:
- If "Late Shipment" = shipped after promised ship date ‚Üí I need to optimize pickup times and induction speed
- If "Late Shipment" = delivered after promised delivery date ‚Üí I need to optimize transit times and service level selection

**Example scenario I need clarification on**:
```
Customer orders on Monday 10am
Promised ship date: Tuesday (next business day)
Actual ship date: Wednesday (1 day late)
Delivery date: Friday (still arrives on time for promised delivery)

Question: Is this counted as a "late shipment" because it shipped late,
even though it delivered on time?
```

---

### 2. Amazon On-Time Delivery Rate (95.69%)

**Question**: How does Amazon calculate the "promised delivery date"?

**What I need to know**:
- Is the promised delivery date shown to the customer at checkout?
- Is it based on **shipping speed selected** (Standard, Expedited, 2-Day, 1-Day)?
- What are the typical delivery windows by shipping speed?
  - Standard Shipping: ___ business days?
  - Expedited Shipping: ___ business days?
  - Two-Day Shipping: ___ business days?
  - One-Day Shipping: ___ business days?
- Does Amazon calculate from **order date** or **ship date**?
- Does "business days" include weekends, or only Mon-Fri?

**Why this matters**:
- I need to map your Amazon shipping speed promises to the correct Xparcel service level
- Standard Shipping ‚Üí Xparcel Ground (3-8 days)? Or Xparcel Expedited (2-5 days)?
- Expedited Shipping ‚Üí Xparcel Expedited (2-5 days)? Or Xparcel Priority (1-3 days)?

**Example scenario I need clarification on**:
```
Customer orders Standard Shipping on Monday 10am
Amazon shows promised delivery: Friday (5 business days)
Package ships Tuesday, delivers Saturday (4 calendar days, but 5 business days)

Question: Is Saturday delivery counted as "on time" or "late"
since it's after the Friday promise but within the business day window?
```

---

### 3. Walmart On-Time Delivery Rate (92.8%)

**Question**: How does Walmart calculate "on-time delivery"?

**What I need to know**:
- What is the **promised delivery window** Walmart shows to customers?
- Is it a **specific date** (e.g., "Arrives by Oct 10") or a **date range** (e.g., "Arrives Oct 10-12")?
- Does Walmart calculate from **order date** or **ship date**?
- What are the typical delivery commitments?
  - Standard Shipping: ___ days?
  - Two-Day Shipping: ___ days?
  - Next-Day Shipping: ___ days?
- Does Walmart use business days or calendar days?
- Does the promised delivery vary by **product category** or **seller tier**?

**Why this matters**:
- Your Walmart on-time rate (92.8%) is dangerously close to the 90% threshold
- I need to understand if Walmart's expectations are more aggressive than Amazon's
- This will determine if we need to use Expedited vs. Ground for Walmart orders

**Example scenario I need clarification on**:
```
Customer orders on Monday
Walmart shows: "Arrives by Thursday" (3 business days)
Package ships Tuesday, delivers Friday (1 day late)

Question: Is this counted as late? Or does Walmart have grace periods?
```

---

### 4. Shipping Speed Selection by Order

**Question**: Can you share data on which shipping speeds your customers select?

**What I need to know**:
- % of orders that are **Standard Shipping**
- % of orders that are **Expedited/Two-Day Shipping**
- % of orders that are **Next-Day/One-Day Shipping**
- % of orders that are **Prime** (if applicable on Amazon)

**Why this matters**:
- If 90% of your orders are Standard Shipping ‚Üí I can optimize for Xparcel Ground
- If 50%+ are Expedited ‚Üí I need to shift more volume to Xparcel Expedited or Priority
- This helps me understand which Xparcel service level to default to

**Can you provide this data from**:
- Amazon Seller Central ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Shipping Performance
- Walmart Seller Center ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Shipping Details
- ShipStation ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Shipping Method breakdown

---

### 5. Geographic Distribution by Marketplace

**Question**: Do certain marketplaces ship to different regions?

**What I need to know**:
- Are your Amazon orders concentrated in specific states/regions?
- Are your Walmart orders different geographically than Amazon?
- Do you see different performance by destination zone (East Coast vs. West Coast)?

**Why this matters**:
- If Walmart ships more to Zone 7-8 (cross-country), that explains the 92.8% on-time rate
- If Amazon ships more regionally (Zones 1-4), that supports the 95.69% on-time rate
- I can optimize Xparcel service level selection by destination zone per marketplace

**Can you provide**:
- Top 10 destination states by marketplace (Amazon vs. Walmart)
- Or export from ShipStation filtered by marketplace

---

### 6. ShipStation Integration & Automation

**Question**: How do you currently select Xparcel service levels in ShipStation?

**What I need to know**:
- Are you using **ShipStation automation rules** to select Xparcel Ground vs. Expedited vs. Priority?
- Or are you **manually selecting** service level for each order?
- Are service levels mapped by:
  - Marketplace shipping speed selected by customer?
  - Destination zone?
  - Package weight?
  - Product SKU?
  - Default to one service level for everything?

**Why this matters**:
- If you're defaulting everything to Xparcel Ground ‚Üí that explains the marketplace issues
- I can help you set up **ShipStation automation rules** to intelligently route:
  - Amazon 2-Day orders ‚Üí Xparcel Expedited
  - Amazon Standard Shipping, Zones 1-4 ‚Üí Xparcel Ground
  - Amazon Standard Shipping, Zones 5-8 ‚Üí Xparcel Expedited
  - Walmart orders (closer to threshold) ‚Üí Xparcel Expedited
  - High-value orders ‚Üí Xparcel Priority

**Can you share**:
- Screenshot of your current ShipStation automation rules (if any)
- Or description of how you currently select service levels

---

### 7. Historical Performance Trends

**Question**: When did your marketplace metrics start declining?

**What I need to know**:
- What were your Amazon/Walmart on-time rates **before** you switched to FirstMile?
- What carrier were you using previously?
- When did you start using FirstMile? (What date did volume ramp up?)
- Have the metrics been declining steadily, or was there a sudden drop?

**Why this matters**:
- If metrics were 98% before FirstMile and dropped to 95% after ‚Üí clearly a FirstMile issue
- If metrics were already 93% and dropped to 92% ‚Üí might be seasonal or marketplace-wide
- This helps me understand if the issue is FirstMile-specific or broader operational changes

**Can you provide**:
- Amazon/Walmart performance history from Seller Central (last 90 days chart)
- Date you switched to FirstMile
- Previous carrier performance (if you tracked it)

---

### 8. Specific Tracking Numbers for Late Deliveries

**Question**: Can you provide 10-20 specific tracking numbers that Amazon/Walmart flagged as "late"?

**What I need to know**:
- Tracking numbers for shipments Amazon counted as "late shipment"
- Tracking numbers for shipments Amazon counted as "late delivery"
- Tracking numbers for shipments Walmart counted as "late delivery"

**Why this matters**:
- I can trace these exact shipments through FirstMile's system
- I can identify patterns:
  - Were they all to specific zones?
  - Were they all routed through a specific carrier (e.g., ACI services)?
  - Were they all a specific service level (Ground)?
  - Were they all a specific weight range?
  - Did they get stuck at a specific hub?
- This gives me **exact root cause** instead of assumptions

**Can you export from**:
- Amazon Seller Central ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Filter by "Late Shipment" or "Late Delivery"
- Walmart Seller Center ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Filter by "Late Delivery"
- Provide tracking numbers + order numbers + promised delivery dates

## üéØ WHAT I'LL DO WITH THIS INFORMATION

Once you provide these answers, I can:

### 1. Map Marketplace Promises to Xparcel Service Levels
```
Amazon Standard Shipping (5-8 days) ‚Üí Xparcel Ground (3-8 days) ‚úÖ
Amazon Expedited Shipping (2-4 days) ‚Üí Xparcel Expedited (2-5 days) ‚úÖ
Amazon Two-Day Shipping (2 days) ‚Üí Xparcel Priority (1-3 days) ‚úÖ

Walmart Standard (4-7 days) ‚Üí Xparcel Ground or Expedited? (depends on your answer)
Walmart Two-Day (2 days) ‚Üí Xparcel Priority (1-3 days) ‚úÖ
```

### 2. Configure ShipStation Automation Rules
```
IF marketplace = Amazon AND shipping_speed = "Two-Day"
   THEN use Xparcel Priority

IF marketplace = Amazon AND shipping_speed = "Standard" AND zone IN (1,2,3,4)
   THEN use Xparcel Ground

IF marketplace = Amazon AND shipping_speed = "Standard" AND zone IN (5,6,7,8)
   THEN use Xparcel Expedited

IF marketplace = Walmart
   THEN use Xparcel Expedited (to protect 92.8% on-time rate)
```

### 3. Optimize by Carrier Performance
```
Based on pivot table data:
- Route through ACL_Direct_Regional (2.87 days avg) for Ground-eligible
- Avoid ACI services (4.15-4.35 days avg) or force to Expedited
- Use DHL SmartMail strategically for Zones 1-4 only
```

### 4. Create Proactive Alerts
```
IF in_transit_days > (promised_delivery_date - ship_date - 2 days buffer)
   THEN alert JM Group: "Tracking ABC123 at risk of late delivery"
```

### 5. Generate Marketplace-Specific Reports
```
Daily report showing:
- Projected late shipment rate (Amazon definition)
- Projected on-time delivery rate (Amazon + Walmart definitions)
- At-risk tracking numbers
- Recommended service level adjustments
```
