## Automation Ideas (Future)

### Auto-Store After Analysis Script

Add to end of analysis scripts:

```python
def auto_store_in_memory(analysis_data):
    """
    Automatically format and store analysis in domain memory
    """
    memory_entry = {
        "company": analysis_data["company_name"],
        "industry": analysis_data.get("industry", "eCommerce"),
        "analysis_date": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "pipeline_stage": analysis_data.get("stage", "Unknown"),
        # ... rest of template
    }

    # TODO: Call domain-memory-agent MCP store_document
    # when MCP is available after restart

    return memory_entry
```

### Slash Command Idea

Create `/store-analysis` command that:
1. Reads last completed analysis summary
2. Extracts key fields automatically
3. Prompts for missing fields
4. Stores in domain memory with tags

### Weekly Batch Store

```
"Review all analyses completed this week and store any that aren't in domain memory yet"
```

---

## Search Patterns (When MCP Available)

### Find Similar Deals

```
"Search memory for all deals with 40%+ savings in ecommerce vertical"
```

### Find By Profile

```
"Search memory for lightweight customers (<50% under 1 lb) in discovery stage"
```

### Find By Challenge

```
"Search memory for how we handled live animal compliance objections"
```

### Competitive Intelligence

```
"Search memory for all prospects switching from UPS, show average savings%"
```

### Pipeline Intelligence

```
"Search memory for deals that closed within 14 days, what were the common factors?"
```

## Migration Checklist (For MCP)

When domain-memory-agent MCP is available:

- [ ] Restart Claude Code
- [ ] Verify `mcp__domain-memory-agent__store_document` available
- [ ] Test store_document with sample data
- [ ] Migrate Josh's Frogs from JSON â†’ MCP
- [ ] Migrate Stackd Logistics from JSON â†’ MCP
- [ ] Migrate JM Group NY from JSON â†’ MCP
- [ ] Test semantic_search functionality
- [ ] Test summarize functionality
- [ ] Document search patterns that work best
- [ ] Create shortcut commands for common searches
- [ ] Update this workflow with MCP-specific instructions

## Best Practices

### Always Include
1. **Quantitative data** - Numbers, not adjectives
2. **Specific tags** - 8-12 minimum for good searchability
3. **Next actions** - So future you knows what to do
4. **Critical factors** - Blockers, risks, must-knows

### Never Skip
1. Pipeline stage (critical for filtering)
2. Volume (monthly at minimum)
3. Savings % and $ amount
4. Tags (makes search useful)

### Pro Tips
1. **Tag liberally** - More tags = better search results
2. **Update regularly** - When deal progresses, update the memory
3. **Link related deals** - Tag competitors or similar profiles
4. **Note what worked** - When deal closes, document why

**Next:** Restart Claude Code and migrate to MCP domain-memory-agent for semantic search! ðŸš€
