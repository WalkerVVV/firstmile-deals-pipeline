## 🚨 BREAKING: REID'S NOV 3 TRACKING DATA CONFIRMS COMPLETE FAILURE

**Reid Provided**: 110 tracking numbers on November 3 for investigation
**October 6 Packages**: 89 tracking numbers (80.9% of sample)
**Current Status**: **100% of Oct 6 packages (89/89) still showing "Shipment info received" 28 DAYS LATER**
**Delivered from Oct 6**: **ZERO (0.0%)**

**CRITICAL FINDING**: These 89 packages were electronically manifested but **NEVER physically scanned by carrier** despite 4 weeks passing. Carrier accepted electronic data but never accepted physical packages.

**See Full Analysis**: `Reid_Tracking_Analysis_Nov3_2025.md`

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Critical Service Failure**: October 6, 2025 volume spike caused catastrophic carrier breakdown with 827+ packages experiencing significant delays. Root cause: carrier capacity overwhelmed by 1,990 shipment day (4.5x normal volume).

**Current Status**: **CONFIRMED FAILURE - Reid's Nov 3 sample shows 100% of Oct 6 packages never scanned after 28 days.** Customer relationship at CRITICAL RISK due to zero service recovery.

**Financial Impact**: ACI Direct routing opportunity identified for ~2,800 shipments ($840/month savings) **BLOCKED** pending resolution of this service failure.

## CRITICAL TIMELINE

### October 6, 2025 - Failure Event
- **Volume Spike**: 1,990 shipments tendered (vs typical 400-800/day)
- **Carrier Response**: **97.9% packages never scanned** (142 out of 145 tracked)
- **Status**: "Shipment info received" only - carrier received manifest but never physically scanned
- **Delivery Rate**: **0.0%** for Oct 6 shipments

### October 7-9, 2025 - Crisis Period
- **Oct 7**: 21.4% delivery rate (continued capacity issues)
- **Oct 8**: 24.0% delivery rate (carrier still overwhelmed)
- **Oct 9**: 57.1% delivery rate (first signs of recovery)

### October 13, 2025 - Recovery Milestone
- **Delivery Rate**: 79.2% (normal service restored)
- **Recovery Time**: 7 days from initial failure
- **Remaining Issues**: 827 packages still in-transit, 142 packages with zero scans

### October 20-31, 2025 - Ongoing Impact
- **Packages Undelivered**: 827 shipments still in-transit
- **Packages Beyond SLA**: 441 shipments (63 Expedited, 377 Ground)
- **Customer Impact**: HIGH - BoxiiShip customers demanding delivery updates

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issue: Carrier Capacity Failure
| Metric | Target | Actual | Gap |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Pickup to First Scan | 24 hours | **67.2 hours** | +179% |
| Same-Day Scan Rate | >95% | **35.1%** | -60% |
| Oct 6 Scan Rate | >95% | **2.1%** | -93% |

**Finding**: Carrier had no surge capacity planning for volume fluctuations >2x normal.

### Secondary Issues
1. **No Advance Warning System**: No visibility into carrier capacity constraints before Oct 6
2. **Manual Encoding Issue**: Pre-existing system integration problem (discussed in Oct 2 meeting)
3. **Tracking Visibility Gaps**: Packages showing "info received" status for 25+ days without updates

---

## BUSINESS IMPACT

### Customer Satisfaction Risk
- **Reid Malloch (Primary Contact)**: Under pressure from SE Asia customers for delivery dates
- **Customer Complaints**: Reid's customers demanding specifics on package locations
- **Relationship Status**: HIGH RISK - 827 delayed packages = potential churn
- **Current SLA Performance**: 98.9% (Expedited) - misleading due to in-transit exclusion

### Financial Impact
- **Service Credits Owed**: Likely significant for 441 packages beyond SLA
- **Revenue at Risk**: BoxiiShip is active customer with optimization opportunities
- **ACI Direct Opportunity**: $10,080 annual savings ($840/month) pending trust restoration

## QUESTIONS FOR ACI TEAM

### REID'S 89 PACKAGES (Priority Questions)

11. How will carrier handle future volume fluctuations (holiday season approaching)?
12. What is compensation/service credit plan for 89+ packages showing 28-day delays + 441 packages beyond SLA?
