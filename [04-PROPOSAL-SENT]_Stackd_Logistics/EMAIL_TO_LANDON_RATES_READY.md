## 🎯 Peak Season Context (If You Have It)

Quick question: **What has DHL told you about Peak Season 2025 fees?**

If you have any info on DHL's peak surcharges (dates, per-package fees, residential upcharges), it'll help me show you an apples-to-apples comparison and highlight where FirstMile can save you even more during the busy season.

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Pick a time that works for you (this week ideally)
2. Review the attached workbook if you'd like (optional)
3. Share any DHL peak season fee info if you have it

Looking forward to walking you through these rates!

Best,
