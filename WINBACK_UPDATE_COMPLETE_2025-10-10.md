## Stage Mapping Note

**Important Discovery**: The stage ID `02d8a1d7-d0b3-41d9-adc6-44ab768a61b8` that was believed to be [08-CLOSED-LOST] is showing as [07-CLOSED-WON] in API responses.

**Implications**:
- Stage mapping in NEBUCHADNEZZAR_REFERENCE.md may need updating
- The `check_priority_deals.py` script uses outdated stage map
- Deal is correctly placed for win-back tracking regardless of label

**Recommendation**: Audit complete stage mapping to ensure accuracy across all scripts and documentation.

- Not captured by 9AM automated sync
- $7.1M opportunity not flagged

### After Update
- Deal clearly marked as "WIN-BACK" in title
- Comprehensive documentation in notes
- Priority: HIGH maintained

## Integration with Yesterday's Updates

This update completes the reconciliation from yesterday's manual updates:

**Yesterday (10/9/25)**:
- ✅ Note created (ID: 91076564745) with RATE-1903 status

## Automated Sync Enhancement Recommendation

To prevent this issue in the future, recommend expanding the 9AM sync to include:

1. **All Stages**: Include [06-IMPLEMENTATION], [07-CLOSED-WON], [08-CLOSED-LOST]
2. **Recent Updates**: Query deals with notes updated in last 48 hours
3. **WIN-BACK Filter**: Search for "WIN-BACK" in deal names
4. **Priority Flag**: Always surface HIGH priority deals regardless of stage
