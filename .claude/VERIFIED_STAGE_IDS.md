## ‚ùì MISSING STAGES

### [00-LEAD] - Not in HubSpot Pipeline
Your folder structure has `[00-LEAD]` but HubSpot FM pipeline starts at "Discovery Scheduled".

**Options**:
1. Create new stage in HubSpot before Discovery Scheduled
2. Map [00-LEAD] folders to [01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED] stage
3. Use [00-LEAD] as local-only pre-pipeline stage

### [09-WIN-BACK] - Not in Current Pipeline
Your folder structure has `[09-WIN-BACK]` but it's not in the FM pipeline.

**Options**:
1. Add "Win Back" stage after Closed Lost in HubSpot
2. Map [09-WIN-BACK] folders to a custom property
3. Use [09-WIN-BACK] as local-only re-engagement tracking

## ‚úÖ CONFLICTS RESOLVED

### Previous Conflict #1: [03-RATE-CREATION]
**RESOLVED**: Verified ID is `e1c4321e-afb6-4b29-97d4-2b2425488535`

**Sources Reconciled**:
- ‚úÖ HubSpot API (Direct): `e1c4321e-afb6-4b29-97d4-2b2425488535`
- ‚ùå Old Source (pipeline_sync_verification.py): `1090865183` (This was actually Discovery Scheduled!)

**Finding**: The old script had Discovery Scheduled labeled as "Rate Creation" - wrong mapping.

### Previous Conflict #2: [06-IMPLEMENTATION]
**RESOLVED**: Verified ID is `08d9c411-5e1b-487b-8732-9c2bcbbd0307`

### Previous Unknown: [05-SETUP-DOCS-SENT]
**RESOLVED**: Verified ID is `4e549d01-674b-4b31-8a90-91ec03122715`

## üìä METADATA INSIGHTS

### Stage Probabilities (Win Likelihood)
```yaml
Discovery Scheduled:  20%  (1 in 5 will close)
Discovery Complete:   20%  (same as above)
Rate Creation:        40%  (2 in 5 will close)
Proposal Sent:        60%  (3 in 5 will close)
Setup Docs Sent:      80%  (4 in 5 will close)
Implementation:       90%  (9 in 10 will close)
Started Shipping:    100%  (closed won)
Closed Lost:           0%  (closed lost)
```

### Pipeline Progression
- **Early Stage** (Discovery): 20% probability
- **Mid Stage** (Rate/Proposal): 40-60% probability
- **Late Stage** (Setup/Implementation): 80-90% probability
- **Closed**: 100% or 0%

### Bottleneck Analysis
Based on probability jumps:
- **Biggest Jump**: Rate Creation ‚Üí Proposal Sent (40% ‚Üí 60%) = +20%
  - This is where deals either commit or stall
- **Critical Stage**: Setup Docs Sent (80% probability)
  - Verbal commit received, high likelihood to close
