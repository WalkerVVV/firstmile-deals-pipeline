# HubSpot MCP Connection Status

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025
**System**: Nebuchadnezzar v2.0

---

## Current Status: ⚠️ NOT CONNECTED

### What We Found

**HubSpot MCP Server**: Not currently connected to Claude Code
- **Configuration File Exists**: `.claude/.claude.json` has correct API key and Portal ID
- **API Key Works**: Successfully queried HubSpot API directly via curl and HubSpot CLI
- **MCP Package**: `@hubspot/mcp-server` is available via npm

### Why It's Not Connected

The HubSpot MCP server configuration exists in the project-level `.claude.json` but Claude Code is not loading it. This is likely because:

1. **Environment Variables**: The MCP server needs the API key and Portal ID passed as environment variables
2. **Global vs Project Config**: Claude Code may not be reading the project-level MCP config
3. **MCP Server Restart**: May need to restart Claude Code after adding MCP server

---

## Current Workaround: HubSpot CLI + Python Scripts

### What's Working Now

You have **two working methods** for HubSpot integration:

#### Method 1: HubSpot CLI (`hs` command)
```bash
# Installed at: C:/Users/BrettWalker/AppData/Roaming/npm/hs
# Version: 7.7.0

# Example: Get pipeline stages
hs api crm.pipelines.pipelinesApi.getAll --object-type=deals
```

#### Method 2: Direct API via curl/Python
```bash
# Example: Get all pipelines
curl -X GET "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pat-na1-3044b6ba-1d68-4ad0-9bca-de8904bb0764"
```

#### Method 3: Python Scripts
```bash
# Your existing scripts work perfectly
python pipeline_sync_verification.py
python daily_9am_workflow.py
```

### What's NOT Working

**HubSpot MCP Tools**: The MCP-specific tools like `hubspot:search-objects` are not available because the MCP server isn't connected.

This means commands like:
```bash
qm hubspot create-lead      # May not work via MCP
qm hubspot search-deals     # May not work via MCP
```

## Configuration Details

### Project-Level Config (Exists)
**Location**: `C:\Users\BrettWalker\FirstMile_Deals\.claude\.claude.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hubspot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@hubspot/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HUBSPOT_API_KEY": "pat-na1-3044b6ba-1d68-4ad0-9bca-de8904bb0764",
        "HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID": "46526832"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Config (Also Added)
**Location**: `C:\Users\BrettWalker\.claude.json`

The MCP server was added to global config but without environment variables.

---

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Use What Works (Recommended)

**Keep using**:
- HubSpot CLI (`hs` command) for API queries
- Python scripts for automation (`pipeline_sync_verification.py`, etc.)
- Direct API calls via curl for one-off operations

**Advantage**: Already working, no setup needed, fully functional

**Disadvantage**: Can't use MCP-specific integrations within Claude Code conversations

### Option 2: Fix MCP Connection (If Needed)

**Only pursue this if you specifically need MCP tools in Claude Code conversations**

Steps to try:
1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Verify the MCP server package is installed globally:
   ```bash
   npm list -g @hubspot/mcp-server
   ```
3. If not installed, install it:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @hubspot/mcp-server
   ```
4. Check if there's a global MCP config that needs updating
5. Test connection: `claude mcp list`

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Current State)

**Use**:
- Python scripts for daily syncs and automation
- HubSpot CLI for direct API queries
- MCP tools for other services (Notion, Kapture are working)

**Advantage**: No changes needed, everything functional

## What You Can Do Today (Without MCP)

### ✅ Working Operations

1. **Verify Stage IDs**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deals" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer pat-na1-3044b6ba-1d68-4ad0-9bca-de8904bb0764"
   ```

2. **Search Deals**:
   ```bash
   hs api crm.objects.deals.search --payload '{"filterGroups":[{"filters":[{"propertyName":"hubspot_owner_id","operator":"EQ","value":"699257003"}]}]}'
   ```

3. **Pipeline Sync**:
   ```bash
   python pipeline_sync_verification.py
   ```

4. **Daily Workflows**:
   ```bash
   python daily_9am_workflow.py
   python daily_9am_sync.py
   ```

### ❌ Not Available (Without MCP)

- Direct HubSpot tool calls within Claude Code conversations
- `hubspot:search-objects` tool
- `hubspot:create-deal` tool
- `hubspot:update-deal` tool

**Impact**: Minimal - Your Python scripts already do all of this

---

## Verification Commands

### Check MCP Status
```bash
claude mcp list
```

**Expected Output** (Current):
```
kapture: ✓ Connected
notion: ✓ Connected
hubspot: ✗ Not listed (or Failed to connect)
```

### Check HubSpot CLI
```bash
hs --version
```

**Expected Output**: `7.7.0` ✅

### Test API Key
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pat-na1-3044b6ba-1d68-4ad0-9bca-de8904bb0764" \
  | head -c 200
```

**Expected**: JSON response starting with `{"results":[` ✅

## Decision Matrix

| Need | Solution | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Daily pipeline sync | Python scripts | ✅ Working |
| Stage ID verification | HubSpot CLI or curl | ✅ Working |
| Deal search/update | Python + API | ✅ Working |
| Automation workflows | N8N + Python | ✅ Working |
| MCP tools in conversations | HubSpot MCP | ⚠️ Not connected |

**Recommendation**: Continue with Python scripts and HubSpot CLI. MCP connection is optional for your workflow.

---

## Next Steps (If You Want MCP)

1. **Verify Package Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm list -g @hubspot/mcp-server
   # If not found:
   npm install -g @hubspot/mcp-server
   ```

2. **Check Global Config**:
   ```bash
   cat C:\Users\BrettWalker\.claude.json
   ```

3. **Test Direct MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   npx @hubspot/mcp-server
   # Should start server if package works
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Code**: Completely close and reopen

5. **Verify**: `claude mcp list`

---

## Summary

**Current State**: HubSpot integration is **fully functional** via Python scripts and CLI, but MCP server is not connected.

**Impact**: None for daily operations. All workflows work as designed.

**Action Required**: None, unless you specifically need MCP tools in Claude Code conversations.

**Alternative**: Keep using the proven, working Python script approach.
