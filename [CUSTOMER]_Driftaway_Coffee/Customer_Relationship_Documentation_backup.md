## ISSUE ANALYSIS

### Root Cause
**Setup Change Without Notification**: ACI carrier was added to a long-term DHL-only account without:
1. Customer notification
2. Sales rep notification (Brett)
3. Testing or validation
4. Communication plan

### System Failure
**Carrier Missort at DHL**: ACI labels were physically dropped at DHL facilities, causing:
- DHL to set packages aside (wrong carrier)
- Packages not scanned into tracking system
- Forced returns to sender
- Extended delivery delays (weeks)

### Communication Breakdown
**Multiple Failure Points**:
1. Setup change made without customer communication
2. Setup change made without sales rep notification
3. Customer support ticket went unanswered for 7 days (Sept 11-18)
4. Customer escalated to sales rep directly

### Impact Assessment
**Customer Impact**:
- 46 ACI shipments affected
- 31 shipments still outstanding after initial returns
- Multiple end-customer complaints
- Brand damage to Driftaway Coffee reputation
- Revenue loss from service suspension
- Trust erosion in FirstMile service reliability

**FirstMile Impact**:
- Customer service suspension (domestic volume lost)
- 23-day resolution timeline (Sept 11 - Oct 2)
- Leadership escalation required for approval
- Process compliance delays (Keith approval requirement)

---

## CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION PATTERN

### Suyog's Communication Style
- **Professional and detailed**: Provided comprehensive issue documentation
- **Proactive**: Created Google Sheet with affected shipments
- **Action-oriented**: Made business decision to suspend service
- **Persistent**: Escalated when support didn't respond
- **Collaborative**: Willing to work with sales rep directly

### Key Customer Concerns
1. Tracking system reliability
2. Delivery performance
3. Communication responsiveness
4. End-customer satisfaction
5. Brand reputation protection

---

## FIRSTMILE RESPONSE ANALYSIS

### Positive Response Elements
1. **Account Manager Investigation**: Melissa quickly identified root cause via transit report
2. **Sales Rep Ownership**: Brett took immediate ownership and escalated properly
3. **Leadership Engagement**: Brock and Zach engaged quickly for resolution
4. **Solution Commitment**: Leadership approved ACI removal within 10 days

### Response Gaps
1. **Initial Support Failure**: 7-day gap before customer escalation
2. **Process Bureaucracy**: 23 days total resolution time
3. **Approval Complexity**: Required Kevin verbal + Keith formal approval
4. **Proactive Communication**: No outreach when setup changed

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### Process Improvements Needed
1. **Setup Change Protocol**: Require customer and sales rep notification for carrier changes
2. **Testing Requirements**: Test carrier routing before production deployment
3. **Support Response SLA**: Maximum 24-hour response for customer inquiries
4. **Approval Streamlining**: Reduce approval layers for customer-impacting issues

### Communication Improvements
1. **Proactive Notification**: Alert customers before setup changes
2. **Sales Rep Inclusion**: Keep sales reps informed of account changes
3. **Status Updates**: Regular updates during issue resolution
4. **Documentation**: Clear audit trail of setup changes

### Technical Improvements
1. **Carrier Validation**: System checks to prevent missorted packages
2. **Tracking Monitoring**: Alert on unusual "not scanned" patterns
3. **Label Clarity**: Ensure carrier labels clearly distinguish routing

---

## RECOVERY PLAN

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
- [x] ACI removed from setup (Oct 2, 2025)
- [x] Leadership approval obtained
- [x] Customer notified of resolution

### Next Steps (Pending)
- [ ] Brett to confirm with Suyog that ACI is removed
- [ ] Offer to monitor first batch of shipments post-resumption
- [ ] Request customer resume domestic FirstMile services
- [ ] Schedule follow-up call to review performance
- [ ] Document lessons learned in account file

### Relationship Repair Strategy
1. **Acknowledge failure**: Own the setup change mistake
2. **Demonstrate fix**: Show ACI removal confirmation
3. **Offer monitoring**: Proactive tracking of next shipments
4. **Build trust**: Regular check-ins until confidence restored
5. **Prevent recurrence**: Share process improvements made

---

## ACCOUNT VALUE ASSESSMENT

### Historical Relationship
- **Long-term customer**: DHL-only for many years
- **Stable volume**: Consistent domestic shipments
- **International trust**: Continued international services during suspension
- **Relationship strength**: Customer escalated to sales rep (not competitor)

### Recovery Potential
**High likelihood of recovery based on**:
1. Customer maintained international services (trust signal)
2. Customer escalated internally rather than switching immediately
3. Long-term relationship history
4. Clear resolution path (ACI removal)
5. Brock's assessment: "strong possibility we can get them to turn us back on quickly"

---

## RISK FACTORS

### Ongoing Risks
1. **Outstanding shipments**: 31 packages still not returned
2. **End-customer complaints**: Driftaway Coffee reputation damage
3. **Trust erosion**: 23-day resolution may have deepened concerns
4. **Competitive vulnerability**: Competitor conversations likely during suspension

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Expedite outstanding returns**: Track down remaining 31 packages
2. **Performance guarantee**: Offer SLA guarantee for next 30 days
3. **Dedicated support**: Assign priority support contact
4. **Regular reporting**: Weekly performance reports during recovery period
