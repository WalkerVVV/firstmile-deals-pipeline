## 2. FirstMile Network Fit

### 2.1 National vs Select Network Allocation

| Volume Segment                    | Current Service        | Proposed Network               | Daily Volume |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| <1 lb to Select metros            | USPS GA ($4.08-$7.27) | **Select • Xparcel Ground**    | 401          |
| <1 lb to National coverage        | USPS GA ($4.08-$7.27) | **National • Xparcel Ground**  | 328          |
| 1-5 lb standard shipments         | Mixed ($6.63-$10.71)  | **National • Xparcel Ground**  | 220          |
| Time-sensitive/Priority           | USPS PM ($9.78-$9.84) | **National • Xparcel Priority** | 30           |
| Heavy shipments (>5 lb)           | UPS ($12.15-$35.04)   | **National • Xparcel Ground**  | 21           |

### 2.2 Routing Logic Implementation

```
IF weight <= 15 oz AND dest_zip IN [Select_Metro_ZIPs]  => Select • Xparcel Ground
ELSE IF weight <= 15 oz                                  => National • Xparcel Ground  
ELSE IF service_level = "PRIORITY"                       => National • Xparcel Priority
ELSE IF weight > 80 oz                                   => National • Xparcel Ground
ELSE                                                     => National • Xparcel Ground
```

### 2.3 FirstMile Differentiators Applied to Caputron

- **Dynamic Routing**: Manhattan origin enables optimal zone-skipping to FL, CA, TX metros
- **Audit Queue**: Critical for preventing dimensional weight overcharges on lightweight medical devices
- **Single Support Thread**: Consolidates current dual-carrier complexity into unified platform
