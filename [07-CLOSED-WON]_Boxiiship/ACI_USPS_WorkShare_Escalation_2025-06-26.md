# ACI USPS Work Share Escalation Request
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**From:** Brett Walker, FirstMile  
**To:** ACI Operations Team  
**Subject:** Urgent: 186 CA Packages Stuck in USPS Work Share Injection - BoxiiShip AF Account

## Executive Summary

We have identified 186 packages shipped via ACI-WS (USPS Work Share) service that are experiencing critical delays at the USPS injection point. These packages show "Departed any of the carrier facilities" status but have not progressed through USPS network processing. This failure represents $2M in customer revenue at risk.

## Current Situation

**Affected Packages:** 186 total (100% ACI-WS service)
- 134 packages (72%) show final scan as "Departed carrier facilities"
- Average days in transit: 7-15 days with no USPS acceptance scan
- Geographic concentration: California destinations

**Service Impact:**
- Customer: BoxiiShip American Fork (Make Wellness)
- Service Level: Priority Xparcel via ACI-WS
- SLA Failure Rate: 100% for affected packages

## Root Cause Analysis

Our analysis indicates the breakdown occurs at the handoff between ACI facilities and USPS Work Share network:
1. Packages successfully leave ACI sorting facilities
2. No USPS acceptance scan recorded
3. Packages remain in limbo between networks
4. California USPS facilities appear overwhelmed during peak volume

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Induction Status Report** (Within 4 hours)
   - Confirm physical location of all 186 packages
   - Identify specific USPS facilities for handoff
   - Provide manifest confirmation of USPS acceptance

2. **USPS Facility Mapping** (Within 24 hours)
   - List all CA USPS facilities in your injection network
   - Current capacity status for each facility
   - Alternative injection points available

3. **Recovery Plan** (Within 24 hours)
   - Expedited re-injection process for stuck packages
   - Direct escalation to USPS district managers
   - Daily status updates until resolution

## Business Impact

- **Revenue at Risk:** $2M deal closing June 30, 2025
- **Customer Impact:** 700+ end consumers awaiting deliveries
- **Reputational Risk:** Major customer considering carrier switch

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Immediate:** Locate and re-inject stuck packages
2. **Short-term:** Implement CA-specific overflow routing
3. **Long-term:** Diversify Work Share injection network

## Response Requirements

Please acknowledge receipt and provide initial status within 2 hours. We require a comprehensive action plan by EOD June 26, 2025.
