# DYLN Deal Status Update - October 24, 2025

## Current Status: ON HOLD - DHL Partnership Conflict

**Deal Value**: $3.6M annual
**HubSpot Deal ID**: 43542873685
**Stage**: [01-QUALIFIED]
**Primary Contact**: Dorian Ayres (ship@dyln3pl.com), Dylan Rees

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONTEXT - DHL Conflict Resolution

### Situation Summary

**Issue**: Dylan/DYLN was simultaneously working with DHL and FirstMile for shipping solutions.

**Resolution**: FirstMile relinquished DHL business to DHL directly to avoid conflict.

**Impact**: RATE-1907 will NOT be delivered to Dylan Rees because:
1. FirstMile cannot present DHL rates to DYLN (conflict of interest)
2. Volume must be recalculated for Select Network only (excluding DHL volume)
3. New rates would need to be created based on revised volume assumptions

---

## Status of RATE-1907

**Jira Ticket**: RATE-1907
**Original Due Date**: October 10, 2025
**Current Status**: HOLD - Not being delivered

**Reason**: Deal structure changed due to DHL partnership. Cannot deliver DHL-inclusive rates.

---

## Next Steps (If Deal Reactivates)

1. **Clarify Volume Split**:
   - Determine how much volume Dylan plans to send via DHL
   - Calculate remaining volume available for FirstMile Select Network
   - Determine if volume is sufficient for competitive Select Network rates

2. **Rate Recalculation**:
   - Create NEW rate request (not RATE-1907)
   - Base rates on Select Network volume only
   - Ensure rates are competitive at reduced volume levels

3. **Customer Communication**:
   - Explain rate structure based on available volume
   - Set clear expectations about Select vs National network fit
   - Present value proposition for remaining volume opportunity

---

## Historical Context

### Original Opportunity
- **Volume**: 24,000 monthly packages
- **Services**: DHL eCom (customer preferred) + FirstMile Xparcel options
- **Competitive Situation**: Customer evaluating 6 carriers

### DHL Conflict Discovery
- Dylan was working directly with DHL simultaneously
- FirstMile made business decision to step aside on DHL business
- Focus shifted to non-DHL volume opportunity (if sufficient)

---

## Current Deal Positioning

**Stage**: [01-QUALIFIED]
**Reason**: Deal structure unclear until volume split is determined

**Actions Required Before Advancing**:
- [ ] Clarify with Dylan: How much volume is going to DHL?
- [ ] Clarify with Dylan: Is remaining volume sufficient for FirstMile interest?
- [ ] Internal: Determine minimum volume threshold for Select Network rates
- [ ] If viable: Request new rates based on actual available volume
- [ ] If not viable: Move to [08-CLOSED-LOST] with reason documented

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Qualify Carrier Relationships Early**: Ask about concurrent carrier evaluations upfront
2. **Volume Assumptions**: Always validate volume availability and exclusivity
3. **DHL Conflicts**: Be aware of DHL partnership dynamics in deal qualification
4. **Rate Investment**: Don't invest in rate creation until volume is locked

---

## Communication Guidelines

**For Future Follow-ups with Dylan**:
- Acknowledge DHL partnership decision
- Focus on remaining volume opportunity
- Be transparent about minimum volume requirements
- Only proceed with rate creation if volume justifies investment

**For Internal Team**:
- DYLN is NOT urgent or critical at this time
- RATE-1907 should be closed/cancelled (not delivered)
- Do not flag DYLN as "overdue" in pipeline reports
- Deal may reactivate if volume split becomes favorable
