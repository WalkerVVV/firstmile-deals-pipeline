**Subject**: Make Wellness Relaunch - Updated FirstMile Rates & Peak Season Information

Hi Nate,

Great connecting today about bringing Make Wellness back to FirstMile! I'm excited about the phased relaunch plan and the $45K/week savings opportunity we discussed.

### Updated Rate Card

As promised, here are your **updated FirstMile rates** effective immediately:

**Attached**: `Boxiiship Rate Comparison Tool 10-9-2025.xlsx`

**Key rate highlights for Make Wellness volume**:
- **Xparcel Priority (DHL-M)** - 1-3 day service:
  - 2 lb packages: Up to $0.72 savings per package (Zones 1-4)
  - 3 lb packages: Up to $0.78 savings per package
  - Aggressive reductions targeting your lightweight volume (1-6 lbs)

- **Xparcel Expedited Select** - 2-5 day service:
  - 2 lb packages: Up to $0.44 savings per package (Zones 1-4)
  - 3 lb packages: Up to $0.57 savings per package

These rates represent **3-8% additional savings** on top of the already significant UPS differential we discussed. With Make Wellness's projected 10k-30k packages/month, this translates to **substantial cost recovery** vs. what you've been paying UPS since July.

### Peak Season Cutoff Dates (2025)

**Critical Deadlines for Pre-Christmas Delivery (December 25)**:

**FirstMile Xparcel Services**:
- **Xparcel Priority** (1-3 day): Last ship date **Thursday, December 18**
- **Xparcel Expedited** (2-5 day): Last ship date **Tuesday, December 16**
- **Xparcel Ground** (3-8 day): Last ship date **Monday, December 15**

**Peak Surcharge Period**: November 25, 2025 - January 15, 2026
- Residential delivery surcharge: +$0.50-$1.00 per package
- Oversized package surcharge: +$2.00-$3.00 per package

⚠️ **Important**: These cutoff dates are for shipments tendered TO FirstMile by the dates listed. Make Wellness should plan to have packages picked up no later than these dates to ensure pre-Christmas delivery.

### Network Improvements & White Glove Service

As we discussed, the April 2025 routing issues have been **fully resolved** through enhanced network management:

✅ **FAST Group Network**: FirstMile, ACI, and Sindel working together as one integrated network
✅ **ZIP Limit Controls**: Strict ZIP limits in place to ensure delivery performance targets are met
  - 90-95% delivery by Day 3 for Xparcel Priority/Exp Plus
  - 90-95% delivery by Day 5 for Xparcel Expedited
✅ **5+ months of stable performance** (May-October 2025)
✅ **White Glove Service for Make Wellness**:
  - Weekly touchbase meetings to review performance
  - Weekly transit time monitoring and reporting
  - Dedicated account oversight to ensure exceptional experience

### Next Steps for Make Wellness Relaunch

**This Week** (Starting immediately):
1. ✅ **Rates delivered** (this email)
2. ⏳ **Peak cutoff dates** (tomorrow morning)
3. ⏳ **Weekly check-in scheduled** (15 min recurring call)
4. ⏳ **Enhanced tracking enabled** for all Make Wellness shipments

**Phased Ramp-Up Plan**:
- **Week 1**: 10k packages/month baseline
- **Week 2-4**: Scale to 20k-30k packages/month
- **Ongoing**: Weekly performance reviews, daily SLA monitoring

### Supplies & Logistics

Per our discussion, I'm confirming with **Jim** that:
- Gaylords and pallets have been received at your facility
- Additional supplies are en route as needed

I'll follow up separately once I hear back from Jim.

### In-Person Meeting - Next Week

I'm also sending you a separate calendar invite for an **in-person meeting at your American Fork facility next week**. This will give us a chance to:
- Review performance metrics in person
- Walk through the enhanced tracking visibility
- Address any questions from the Make Wellness team
- Celebrate bringing this partnership back online!

### Summary: The Make Wellness Win-Back Opportunity

**Financial Impact**:
- **Current UPS overpayment**: $45K-$50K/week (26+ weeks = $1.17M-$1.3M lost since July)
- **FirstMile savings with new rates**: $45K-$50K/week recovered
- **Annual savings for Make Wellness**: $2.34M-$2.6M vs. current UPS costs

**Volume Recovery**:
- **Target**: 10k-30k packages/month (phased ramp-up starting this week)
- **Annual revenue recovery for FirstMile**: ~$7.1M

This is a huge win-win, and I'm committed to making sure Make Wellness has an exceptional experience from day one of the relaunch.

Let me know if you have any questions on the rates or need anything else to finalize the restart!

Best regards,
Brett Walker
FirstMile
