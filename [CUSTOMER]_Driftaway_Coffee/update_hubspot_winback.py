üéØ OBJECTIVE: Resume domestic FirstMile/Xparcel services after ACI incident resolution

BACKGROUND:
‚Ä¢ Long-term customer (DHL-only for many years)
‚Ä¢ Service suspended Sept 11, 2025 due to ACI missort incident
‚Ä¢ 46 shipments affected, customer had end-customer complaints
‚Ä¢ ACI removed from setup Oct 2, 2025

4. Direct line to Brett: 402-718-4727
5. Expedite tracking for remaining 31 outstanding packages

RECOVERY INDICATORS:
‚úì Customer maintained international services (didn't switch completely)
‚úì Customer escalated to sales rep (Brett) vs going to competitor
‚úì Long-term relationship history (years with FirstMile)
‚úì Clear resolution path (ACI removed per leadership approval)

RISK FACTORS:
