## FirstMile Opportunity Analysis

### Why This Lead Matters

**High-Value 3PL Partner Potential**:
- 3PLs like Proven Prep aggregate shipping volume from multiple clients
- Currently using "multi-carrier pass-through" model = not optimized
- FirstMile partnership could become their primary carrier recommendation

**Strategic Advantages**:
1. **Volume Aggregation**: 500K-1M units/year from single partner
2. **Client Referrals**: Their ~100+ clients could be introduced to FirstMile
3. **Geographic Fit**: Portland location ideal for West Coast → nationwide Xparcel routing
4. **Service Match**: Their same-day processing aligns with Xparcel expedited options

### Recommended Approach

**Discovery Call Topics**:
1. Current carrier mix and negotiated rates
2. Client pain points with shipping costs/speed
3. Interest in becoming FirstMile recommended partner
4. Volume breakdown by service level (Ground vs. Expedited)
5. South Carolina expansion carrier needs

**Value Proposition for Proven Prep**:
- Consolidated carrier relationship (simplify operations)
- Potential for better rates than current multi-carrier setup
- Co-marketing opportunity as FirstMile certified partner
- Zone-skipping benefits for East Coast shipments (especially with SC expansion)
