## CORRECTED INFORMATION

### FAST Group Network Structure

**CORRECT**:
- **FirstMile, ACI, and Sindel are together as the FAST Group**
- Operating as one unified, integrated network
- ACI (including ACI-WS) **IS part of** the FirstMile network
- All facilities work together under FAST Group management

**INCORRECT** (Previous messaging):
- ❌ "ACI-WS removed from routing"
- ❌ Implying ACI-WS is separate or excluded
- ❌ Suggesting facility removal was the solution

---

## Routing & Performance Management

### ZIP Limit Strategy

**CORRECT Approach**:
- **ZIP limits are in place** to ensure delivery performance targets
- Performance targets:
  - **90-95% delivery by Day 3** for Xparcel Priority/Exp Plus
  - **90-95% delivery by Day 5** for Xparcel Expedited
- ZIP limits control which destinations go to which facilities
- **ACI facilities (including ACI-WS) WILL be used** where ZIP limits ensure performance

**Solution**: Smart routing with ZIP limit controls, NOT facility exclusion

## Key Messaging Points

### For Customer-Facing Communications:

**DO SAY**:
- "FirstMile FAST Group network (FirstMile, ACI, Sindel)"
- "ZIP limit controls ensure delivery performance"
- "90-95% delivery performance targets enforced"
- "White glove service with weekly monitoring"
- "Integrated network working together"

**DON'T SAY**:
- ❌ "ACI-WS removed from routing"
- ❌ "No ACI-WS routing for your volume"
- ❌ Any language suggesting facility exclusion
- ❌ Implying ACI is separate from FirstMile

## Rationale for Correction

### Why ZIP Limits, Not Facility Removal?

1. **Network Efficiency**: Using all FAST Group facilities maximizes capacity and coverage
2. **Performance Control**: ZIP limits ensure only high-performing routes are used
3. **Flexibility**: Allows network optimization while maintaining SLA compliance
4. **Scalability**: Enables growth without facility constraints

### April 2025 Root Cause

**Problem**: ZIP limits were too broad, allowing routing that couldn't meet SLA
**Solution**: Tightened ZIP limits to ensure 90-95% performance targets
**Result**: Same facilities can be used, but only for destinations they can serve on time

## Customer Reassurance Strategy

### Trust Rebuilding Through Transparency

1. **FAST Group Integration**: Demonstrate unified network strength
2. **ZIP Limit Controls**: Show technical safeguards in place
3. **Weekly Monitoring**: Prove continuous oversight and accountability
4. **Performance Targets**: Clear, measurable commitments (90-95%)
5. **White Glove Service**: Dedicated attention to Make Wellness experience

**Document Purpose**: Ensure all team members use accurate, consistent messaging about FAST Group network and routing management.

**Critical**: This is an operational win-back requiring precision in how we describe our network capabilities and performance controls.
