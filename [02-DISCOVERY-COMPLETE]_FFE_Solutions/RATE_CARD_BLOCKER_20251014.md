# FFE Solutions Rate Card Creation - BLOCKER

**Date:** October 14, 2025 10:35 AM MST
**Status:** ðŸš§ BLOCKED - Missing Discovery Data

## Issue

Cannot create rate card for FFE Solutions - no discovery notes or volume data available.

## Required Information

To create an accurate rate card and savings analysis, we need:

1. **Volume Profile:**
   - Monthly package count
   - Daily average
   - Seasonal variations

2. **Weight Distribution:**
   - % under 1 lb
   - % 1-5 lbs
   - % over 5 lbs
   - Average package weight

3. **Geographic Mix:**
   - Top destination states
   - Zone distribution (1-4 vs 5-8)
   - Regional vs cross-country %

4. **Current Carrier Setup:**
   - Who are they using now?
   - Current costs (total spend or per-package average)
   - Service levels used (ground, expedited, express)

5. **Service Requirements:**
   - SLA expectations
   - Special handling needs
   - Return volume

## Recommended Actions

**Option 1: Schedule Discovery Call (RECOMMENDED)**
- Book 30-minute call to gather volume and requirements
- Request sample shipment data (CSV/Excel)
- Understand pain points with current setup
- Timeline: Can complete rate card within 48 hours of receiving data

**Option 2: Email Data Request**
- Send email requesting volume profile and current rate information
- Provide template for what data format we need
- Timeline: Slower, dependent on response time

**Option 3: Check Email History**
- Search inbox for previous communications with FFE Solutions
- Look for volume estimates or shipping profiles mentioned
- May have partial data to work with

## Next Step

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Which approach to take?

If no data exists, recommend moving FFE Solutions BACK to [01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED] stage until we can gather proper requirements.
