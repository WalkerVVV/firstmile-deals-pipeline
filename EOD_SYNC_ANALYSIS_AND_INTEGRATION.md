## 🔌 Integration Gaps & Opportunities

### What's Missing

**Gap 1: Email Activity → HubSpot Sync**
- Superhuman captures email intelligence
- _DAILY_LOG.md gets updated manually
- HubSpot pipeline NOT auto-updated from emails

**Example**: Team Shipper email sent → should trigger:
- HubSpot stage update to [04-PROPOSAL-SENT]
- Folder move from [03-RATE-CREATION] to [04-PROPOSAL-SENT]
- Follow-up cadence activation (Day 1/3/7/10/14)

**Gap 2: EOD Sync Doesn't Include Email Intelligence**
- October 6 EOD sync shows HubSpot data only
- Misses same-day email activity and conversations
- Can't detect stage movements from email evidence

**Gap 3: Manual Copy-Paste Workflow**
- Superhuman AI → _DAILY_LOG.md requires manual copying
- Risk of forgetting to run EOD email analysis
- No automation between Superhuman and HubSpot

---

## 💡 Key Insights from This Week

### Pipeline Health Trend: **DECLINING** 🚨

**Evidence**:
- SLA violations increased (93.5% → 96.8%)
- Bottleneck grew ([03-RATE-CREATION]: 8 → 10 deals)
- High urgency items increased (11 → 13)
- No deals moved out of overdue stages

**Root Causes**:
1. [03-RATE-CREATION] bottleneck not being cleared

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Rate Creation Blitz**: Block 2 days to clear [03-RATE-CREATION]
2. **Overdue Triage**: Call 3 overdue deals (SotoDeals, COLDEST, Team Shipper)
3. **Process Improvement**: Why are deals getting stuck in rate creation?

### Email Intelligence Value: **HIGH** ✅
