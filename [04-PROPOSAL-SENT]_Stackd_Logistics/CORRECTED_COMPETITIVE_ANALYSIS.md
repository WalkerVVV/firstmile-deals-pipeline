# Stackd Logistics - CORRECTED Competitive Analysis

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Critical Correction:** FirstMile Xparcel REPLACES incumbent carriers (DHL, UPS, USPS)
**Competitive Baseline:** DHL eCommerce at $4.37/pkg for ground service

---

## CORRECTED Competitive Framework

### What FirstMile/Xparcel Offers
**Carriers in FirstMile Network:**
- DHL (National Network)
- ACI (Select Network)
- USPS (National Network)

**Service Levels (NON-GUARANTEED):**
- Xparcel Ground (3-8 day) - Economy
- Xparcel Expedited (2-5 day) - Faster ground
- Xparcel Priority (1-3 day) - Premium (but still non-guaranteed)

### What We're Competing Against

**Incumbent DHL eCommerce:**
- **Volume:** 8,418 packages (94% of total)
- **Current Cost:** $4.37/pkg average
- **Service:** DHL Parcel Expedited (ground, non-guaranteed)
- **Profile:** Lightweight (<1 lb), 3-8 day delivery

**UPS 2nd Day Air - NOT IN SCOPE:**
- **Volume:** 361 packages (4% of total)
- **Current Cost:** $17.21/pkg average
- **Service:** Guaranteed 2-day delivery
- **Why Excluded:** Xparcel is NON-GUARANTEED, cannot compete with guaranteed products
- **Customer Expectation:** These orders require guaranteed delivery - Xparcel cannot fulfill this need

**USPS Ground Advantage:**
- **Volume:** 127 packages (1.4% of total)
- **Current Cost:** $6.16/pkg average
- **Service:** Ground (2-5 day)
- **Opportunity:** FirstMile can compete here

## The Real Opportunity (CORRECTED)

### Target Market: 94% DHL Ground Volume
**Can FirstMile Xparcel beat $4.37/pkg?**

**Package Profile to Beat:**
- Average weight: 0.317 lbs (5 oz)
- 92.5% under 1 lb
- Utah origin
- Nationwide destinations
- Zones 1-8 distribution

**Critical Question:**
What are FirstMile's Xparcel Ground rates for:
- Utah origin
- Weights: <1 oz, 1-4 oz, 4-8 oz, 8-12 oz, 12-16 oz
- Zones 1-8
- Ground service (3-8 day)

**If FirstMile can offer $3.50-4.00/pkg → WIN**
**If FirstMile rates are $4.50-5.00/pkg → LOSE (can't compete on cost)**

## Revised Savings Calculation

### Scenario 1: FirstMile Beats DHL by 10%
**Assumption:** FirstMile Xparcel Ground at $3.93/pkg (10% below DHL's $4.37)
- **DHL Current Cost:** 8,418 packages × $4.37 = $36,786
- **FirstMile Cost:** 8,418 packages × $3.93 = $33,082
- **Monthly Savings:** $3,704
- **Annual Savings:** $44,448

### Scenario 2: FirstMile Beats DHL by 15%
**Assumption:** FirstMile Xparcel Ground at $3.71/pkg (15% below DHL's $4.37)
- **DHL Current Cost:** $36,786
- **FirstMile Cost:** 8,418 packages × $3.71 = $31,231
- **Monthly Savings:** $5,555
- **Annual Savings:** $66,660

### Scenario 3: FirstMile Beats DHL by 20%
**Assumption:** FirstMile Xparcel Ground at $3.50/pkg (20% below DHL's $4.37)
- **DHL Current Cost:** $36,786
- **FirstMile Cost:** 8,418 packages × $3.50 = $29,463
- **Monthly Savings:** $7,323
- **Annual Savings:** $87,876

## UPS 2nd Day Air Volume - CANNOT COMPETE

**Volume:** 361 packages (4% of total)
**Current Cost:** $17.21/pkg
**Annual Spend:** ~$74,520

**Why We Can't Compete:**
- UPS 2nd Day Air = GUARANTEED 2-day delivery
- Xparcel Priority (1-3d) = NON-GUARANTEED (could be 1 day or 3 days)
- Customer chose guaranteed service for a reason (likely customer SLA requirements)
- Cannot offer apples-to-apples replacement

**Recommendation:** Exclude from proposal. These customers need guaranteed delivery.

## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### 1. Get FirstMile Rate Card for Utah Origin
Need rates for:
- **Origin:** Utah Fulfillment Center (ZIP 84xxx)
- **Weights:** <1 oz, 1-4 oz, 4-8 oz, 8-12 oz, 12-16 oz, 1 lb, 2 lbs
- **Zones:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Service:** Xparcel Ground (3-8 day)

### 2. Apply FirstMile Rates to Actual Data
- Calculate package-by-package FirstMile cost
- Compare to actual DHL cost ($4.37 avg)
- Determine real savings percentage
- Generate savings projection

### 3. Assess Competitiveness
**If FirstMile wins on cost:**
- Proceed with proposal
- Emphasize cost savings + operational benefits

**If FirstMile loses on cost:**
- Reassess deal viability
- Consider operational benefits only (carrier consolidation, tracking, support)
- May not be winnable on economics alone

## Value Proposition (UPDATED)

### Primary: Cost Savings (IF WE CAN BEAT $4.37/pkg)
"FirstMile Xparcel can reduce your ground shipping costs by X% compared to DHL eCommerce while maintaining similar delivery speeds."

### Secondary: Operational Benefits
- **Single platform** for all non-guaranteed services (vs managing DHL + USPS separately)
- **Unified tracking** across DHL, ACI, USPS carriers in FirstMile network
- **Dynamic routing** - FirstMile selects best carrier/route per package
- **Single support contact** for all shipping issues

### Tertiary: Service Quality
- **West Coast optimization** - Select Network (ACI) for faster CA delivery (23% of volume)
- **Audit Queue** - Catches mis-rated labels before billing
- **Claims & Returns** - Single point of contact vs dealing with multiple carriers

---

## Deal Assessment (CORRECTED)

### IF FirstMile Can Beat $4.37/pkg:
**Win Probability:** 70-80%
- Cost savings is compelling
- Lightweight profile (92.5% <1 lb) is FirstMile sweet spot
- Operational benefits add value beyond just cost

### IF FirstMile Cannot Beat $4.37/pkg:
**Win Probability:** 20-30%
- Cost is table stakes for 3PL decision
- Operational benefits alone may not justify switch
- Switching cost (ShipHero integration) is barrier without cost savings

---

## Recommendation

**URGENT:** Need FirstMile rate card for Utah origin BEFORE Landon meeting.

**Cannot present savings estimate without knowing if FirstMile can beat $4.37/pkg baseline.**

If FirstMile rates are available:
1. Apply to 8,957-package dataset
2. Calculate real savings
3. Present data-driven proposal

If FirstMile rates are NOT competitive with DHL:
1. Acknowledge competitive pricing challenge
2. Pivot to operational benefits (single platform, dynamic routing, support)
3. Consider pilot test to prove service quality vs DHL
