## EMAIL DRAFT - OPTION 1: DIRECT & ACCOUNTABLE

**Subject**: URGENT: JM Group Pickup Cancellation - Request for Meeting

Yehoshua and Daniel,

I learned that JM Group cancelled daily pickups as of October 6. I need to speak with you immediately.

I know our September 30 performance report showed 634 packages (37.8%) sitting in-transit outside SLA windows. That's unacceptable, and I take full responsibility for not escalating this more aggressively after sending that report.

**I'm requesting an urgent meeting this week to:**
1. Discuss what happened from your perspective
2. Present the root cause analysis we've completed
3. Commit to specific service improvements
4. Explore restarting pickups with enhanced monitoring

**My availability this week:**
- Today (Monday): 2pm-5pm
- Tuesday: 10am-12pm, 2pm-5pm
- Wednesday: 9am-5pm
- Thursday: 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm

Can we schedule 30-45 minutes? I can come to you or we can do a video call - whatever works best.

I want to make this right.

## EMAIL DRAFT - OPTION 2: COLLABORATIVE & SOLUTIONS-FOCUSED

**Subject**: JM Group - Request for Meeting This Week

Yehoshua and Daniel,

I understand pickups were cancelled on October 6. I'd like to schedule a meeting this week to discuss what happened and how we can address your concerns.

Our September 30 report identified 634 in-transit packages outside SLA windows (37.8%). I recognize this created visibility issues and likely impacted your customer experience. We've completed a root cause analysis and have specific proposals to improve performance.

**Meeting Agenda:**
- Your feedback on service issues
- Root cause findings (Zone 7-8 performance, linehaul timing, induction cadence)
- Service improvement commitments (ZIP-limits, expedited upgrades, proactive monitoring)
- Path forward for resuming service

**This week's availability:**
- Monday: 2pm-5pm
- Tuesday: 10am-12pm, 2pm-5pm
- Wednesday: 9am-5pm
- Thursday: 10am-12pm, 2pm-4pm

30-45 minutes at your location or via video call.

Looking forward to discussing solutions.

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**I recommend Option 3** based on Friday's learning:
- ✅ Short, dedicated email for critical ask
- ✅ No buried requests
- ✅ Clear action required (meeting scheduling)
- ✅ Specific availability windows
- ✅ Acknowledges the issue without over-explaining

**Why Option 3 works:**
1. Gets to the point immediately
2. Shows you know about the cancellation
3. Acknowledges the September 30 report
4. Offers solutions without being defensive
5. Makes scheduling easy with specific times

## TALKING POINTS FOR THE CALL/MEETING

### Opening (2 minutes)
"Thank you for meeting with me. I want to start by acknowledging that our service performance wasn't where it needed to be. The September 30 report I sent you showed 99.9% SLA compliance on delivered packages, but that masked a bigger problem - 634 packages (37.8%) sitting in-transit outside their SLA windows. That's unacceptable."

### Root Cause Findings (5 minutes)
1. **Zone 7-8 Performance Issues**: Long-haul lanes to cross-country destinations struggling to meet 8-day Ground window
2. **Induction Cadence Problems**: Timing delays between pickup and first carrier scan
3. **ZIP Cluster Concentration**: Top 20 ZIPs accounting for majority of late packages

### Service Improvement Commitments (8 minutes)
1. **Immediate ZIP-Limits**: Move problematic destinations from Ground to Expedited (2-5 day window)
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Proactive alerts when packages approaching SLA deadline
3. **Linehaul Optimization**: Adjust induction timing for high-risk lanes
4. **Weekly Performance Reviews**: 30-minute check-ins until we hit 95%+ in-transit on-time rate

### Customer Feedback (10 minutes)
"Before I go further, I need to hear from you:
- What were you experiencing from your customers?
- When did you first notice the service degradation?
- What should we have done differently after the September 30 report?
- What are your minimum performance requirements to consider restarting?"

### Path Forward (10 minutes)
**Phased Restart Proposal:**
- Week 1: Resume pickups with enhanced monitoring, daily performance reports
- Week 2: Validate 95%+ in-transit on-time rate
- Week 3: Full service restoration with weekly check-ins
- Month 2: Performance milestone review

**Performance Guarantee:**
- 95%+ in-transit on-time rate (within SLA window)
- <5% delivered outside SLA
- Proactive alerts for any package approaching SLA deadline
- Weekly performance reports sent every Monday

### Closing (5 minutes)
"I want to earn back your trust. What questions do you have, and what do you need from me to consider giving us another chance?"
