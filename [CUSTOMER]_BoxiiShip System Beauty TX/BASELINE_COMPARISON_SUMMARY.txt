================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE - SLA COMPLIANCE BY SERVICE
================================================================================

SERVICE LEVEL              TOTAL    DELIVERED   ON-TIME   COMPLIANCE   VOLUME%
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
XParcelExpedited (2-5d)    9,849    9,656       6,312     65.4%       54.1%
XParcelGround (3-8d)       8,100    7,623       6,888     90.4%       44.5%
XParcelPriority (1-3d)       237      233         143     61.4%        1.3%
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL REPORTED           18,186   17,512      13,343    76.2%       100%

KEY INSIGHT: Overall 76.2% is weighted by Ground service (90.4%). Actual
user experience varies dramatically - Expedited service (majority volume at
54%) shows poor 65.4% compliance due to systematic 1-3 day delays.

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDING: EXPEDITED SERVICE SYSTEMATIC DELAYS
================================================================================

Late Shipment Pattern Analysis:
  Total Late: 3,018 shipments (31.2% of delivered Expedited)
  
  Days 6-8 (1-3 past SLA):  2,365 shipments (78.4% of late)
    - Day 6 (+1d):   925 ships (30.6% of late)
    - Day 7 (+2d):   862 ships (28.6% of late)
    - Day 8 (+3d):   578 ships (19.2% of late)

Interpretation:
  This is NOT random failures - SYSTEMATIC DELAY PATTERN indicating:
  - Carrier network capacity constraint
  - Routing inefficiency
  - Possible carrier prioritization of other services

Impact:
  - 2,365 shipments affected (24.5% of total Expedited volume)
  - Dragging overall company compliance from potential 85%+ to reported 76.2%

================================================================================
DELIVERY STATUS BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

Status         Count    Percentage   SLA Calculation   Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------
Delivered      17,512   96.3%        Included          Primary metric base
In-Transit       674    3.7%         Excluded          193 are Expedited overdue
Unknown          618    3.4%         Excluded          No status data

================================================================================
SLA CALCULATION METHODOLOGY (VERIFIED)
================================================================================

Formula: SLA Compliance % = (On-Time Delivered) / (Total Delivered) x 100

Verification (all match reported values):
  XParcelExpedited: 6,312 / 9,656 = 65.37% [Reported: 65.4%] YES
  XParcelGround:    6,888 / 7,623 = 90.37% [Reported: 90.4%] YES
  XParcelPriority:    143 /   233 = 61.37% [Reported: 61.4%] YES
  OVERALL:         13,343 / 17,512 = 76.21% [Reported: 76.2%] YES

IMPORTANT: Overall compliance is WEIGHTED by service level, not equal average.

================================================================================
CARRIER PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

Carrier        Volume        Delivered   Delivery Rate   Assessment
-------------------------------------------------------------------
DHL            7,858 (43%)   7,536       95.9%          Largest, lowest rate
ACI-Direct     7,709 (42%)   7,487       97.1%          Highest performance
PostageMates   2,619 (14%)   2,489       95.0%          Smallest carrier

ISSUE: DHL underperforms ACI-Direct by 1.2 percentage points. Since DHL
carries 43% of volume, this directly impacts Expedited compliance.

================================================================================
BASELINE METRICS FOR IMPROVEMENT PLANNING
================================================================================

Current Performance:
  XParcelExpedited:    65.4% (PROBLEM - systematic delays)
  XParcelGround:       90.4% (STRENGTH - well-optimized)
  XParcelPriority:     61.4% (ACCEPTABLE but small volume)
  Overall Reported:    76.2% (masked by Ground excellence)

Improvement Priorities (by impact):

PRIORITY 1: Address Expedited Systematic Delays
  Opportunity: Fix 2,365 late shipments in 6-8 day range
  Impact: Would improve overall compliance from 76.2% to ~82%
  Root Cause: Likely DHL capacity/routing issue

PRIORITY 2: Accelerate In-Transit Shipments
  Opportunity: Complete 193 delayed Expedited shipments
  Risk: Could further reduce compliance if delivered late

PRIORITY 3: Improve DHL Performance
  Opportunity: Improve from 95.9% to match ACI-Direct 97.1%
  Impact: Reduce late shipments by approximately 100/month

PRIORITY 4: Investigate Priority Service
  Opportunity: Understand 61.4% despite strong 2.3 avg transit days
  Impact: Small volume but premium pricing
