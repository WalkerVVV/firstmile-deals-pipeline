Hi Landon,

Quick question to help optimize your Stackd Logistics analysis:

Can you share your top 50-100 destination ZIP codes by volume? This will help me determine if our **Select Network** (metro-focused, lower rates) is a good fit vs. our **National Network**.

Just need:
- Destination ZIP code
- Approximate monthly volume to that ZIP

This will help me fine-tune our rate proposal to ensure you're getting the best possible pricing based on your actual shipping destinations.

Thanks!
