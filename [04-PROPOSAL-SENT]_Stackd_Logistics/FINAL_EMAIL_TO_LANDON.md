## EMAIL BODY

Landon,

**Your Stackd Logistics Xparcel rates are ready.**

I've analyzed your 8,957 shipment history against FirstMile's National Network rates. Bottom line: **you're leaving $4,522 on the table every month.**

### The Numbers

**Current State (DHL)**:
- Monthly spend: $44,453
- Average cost per label: $4.96

**With FirstMile Xparcel Ground**:
- Monthly spend: $39,931
- Average cost per label: $4.46
- **Monthly savings: $4,522 (10.2%)**
- **Annual savings: $54,269**

### Why This Works for Stackd

**92.5% of your packages are under 1 lb** - this is exactly where FirstMile excels with National Network lightweight pricing.

Your sweet spot is the 4-8 oz range (27.2% of your volume), where we're saving you 13.8% on average. Even your heavier packages (1-5 lbs) save 19%+.

### Beyond Cost

You also get operational improvements:
- **Audit Queue**: Blocks mis-rated labels before they hit your invoice
- **Single Integration**: One ShipHero connection for Ground + Expedited + Priority
- **3PL Focus**: We understand your multi-customer model (Chin Mounts, New Age, Tapeher)
- **Unified Support**: Single team for claims, returns, exceptions

### Your Customer Margins Improve Too

Current model: Charge $16.49, pay DHL $4.96 = **69.5% margin**

With FirstMile: Charge $16.49, pay us $4.46 = **73.0% margin (+3.5 points)**

OR pass the savings to your customers to win more business while keeping your margin.

### Let's Review This Week

- Weight and zone breakdowns
