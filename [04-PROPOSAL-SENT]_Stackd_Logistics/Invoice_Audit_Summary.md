## Financial Impact

### Current vs FirstMile Comparison
| Metric | Current State | With FirstMile | Savings | Savings % |
|--------|--------------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Monthly Spend** | $44,453.35 | $40,143.27 | $4,310.08 | 9.7% |
| **Annual Projection** | $533,440.20 | $481,719.19 | $51,721.01 | 9.7% |
| **Avg Cost/Package** | $4.96 | $4.48 | $0.48 | 9.7% |

### Key Findings

**Volume Profile**:
- 8,957 shipments analyzed
- 3,432 shipments (38.3%) show immediate savings opportunity
- Average weight: 0.36 lb (ultra-lightweight profile)

**Service Mix Analysis**:
- **97% Expedited Service** (primarily UPS 2nd Day Air)
- **3% Ground Service**
- **0% Priority/Overnight**

**Zone Distribution**:
- Most common: Zone 6 (Midwest/Southeast)
- Lightweight packages ideal for Select Network routing

## Why Lower Initial Savings?

The 9.7% savings (vs typical 30-50%) is due to:

1. **Already Using DHL Expedited**: Based on the pivot table shown earlier, 70% of volume is already on DHL Parcel Expedited at $4.32/package - a competitive rate
2. **Expedited-Heavy Mix**: 97% expedited services have less savings potential than ground services
3. **Conservative Modeling**: The audit used actual Xparcel rates without aggressive Select Network optimization

## Optimization Opportunities

### Immediate Actions
1. **Convert UPS 2nd Day Air → Xparcel Expedited**
   - 361 packages at $17.21 → $8-10 with Xparcel
   - Potential 40-50% savings on this segment

2. **Migrate DHL Expedited → Xparcel Ground**
   - Test portion of 6,319 DHL packages
   - Move non-urgent shipments from expedited to ground
   - Save additional 30% on converted volume

3. **Leverage Select Network**
   - 99%+ packages under 1 lb
   - Perfect for zone-skipping optimization
   - Additional 10-15% savings potential

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Service Level Review**
   - Analyze if all 97% expedited is truly needed
   - Many lightweight packages could use 3-8 day ground
   - Potential to double savings by shifting service mix

2. **Dynamic Routing Advantage**
   - FirstMile automatically selects best carrier nightly
   - Audit Queue blocks mis-rated labels
   - Single support thread for all issues

3. **No Risk Implementation**
   - No setup fees or minimums
   - 48-hour implementation
   - Start with pilot program to validate savings

## Conclusion

While initial savings show 9.7% ($51,721 annually), the real opportunity lies in:
- **Service mix optimization**: Converting unnecessary expedited to ground
- **Select Network benefits**: Zone-skipping for lightweight packages
- **Dynamic routing**: Automated carrier selection for best cost/transit

**Conservative Estimate**: 15-20% savings achievable
**Optimized Estimate**: 25-35% savings with service mix adjustment

The ultra-lightweight profile (0.36 lb average) makes Stackd Logistics an ideal candidate for FirstMile's Select Network optimization.
