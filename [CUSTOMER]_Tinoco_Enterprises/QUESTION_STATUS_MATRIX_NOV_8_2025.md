**What we're missing**:
- ❌ Xparcel Ground rates (all zones, 1-5 lbs) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
- ❌ USPS GA Zone 5, 4 lbs rate (estimated $10.50, need confirmation)
- ❌ Complete zone-by-zone rate cards for both carriers

**Can we answer?**: NO - Cannot build cost comparison without Xparcel Ground pricing

**Priority**: **🔴 HIGH** - Directly impacts savings calculation and deal viability

**Blocker**: Brycen must provide Xparcel Ground rate card

---

### ❌ Q2: Which zones are most expensive, and what's our coverage gap?
**Status**: **NO - Missing rate data**

**What we have**:
- Zone distribution by volume:
  - Zone 4: 1,577 packages (17%)
  - Zone 5: 2,269 packages (24%)
  - Zone 6: 2,044 packages (22%)
  - Zone 7: 1,699 packages (18%)
  - Zone 8: 1,179 packages (13%)
- **Zones 5-8 = 86% of volume** (7,191 packages) ✅

**What we're missing**:
- ❌ Xparcel Ground rates by zone (Zones 1-8)
- ❌ USPS GA rates by zone (only have Zone 5)
- ❌ Zone-by-zone cost comparison

**Can we answer?**: NO - Have volume distribution but no pricing to compare

**Priority**: **🔴 HIGH** - 86% of volume in Zones 5-8, must know if pricing is competitive

**Blocker**: Need complete rate cards from Brycen and Chase/Juan

---

### ⚠️ Q3: What's the DIM weight cost impact on main product?
**Status**: **PARTIAL - Can estimate, need confirmation**

**What we have**:
- Juggy tumbler dimensions: 11.5 × 9 × 5.5 in = 569 cu in = 0.33 cu ft ✅
- Actual weight: 3 lbs (most common) ✅
- DIM weight calculation: 569 ÷ 139 = 4.09 lbs → bills at 4 lbs ✅
- Brycen's analysis: 83% of Juggy DIMs up by 1 lb ✅
- Affected volume: 2,652 packages/month (83% of 3,196) ✅

**What we're missing**:
- ❌ Confirmed USPS GA rate at 4 lbs (estimated $10.50)
- ❌ Xparcel Ground rate at 3 lbs vs 4 lbs

**Can we answer?**: PARTIAL - Can calculate impact with estimates, but need actual rates for precision

**Estimated calculation**:
- Cost differential: $9.13 (3 lbs) vs $10.50 (4 lbs) = **$1.37 per package**
- Monthly impact: 2,652 packages × $1.37 = **$3,633/month**
- Annual impact: **$43,596**

**Priority**: **🔴 HIGH** - This is the DIM waiver justification (83% of volume affected)

**Action**: Can present estimated impact, but Brycen will want confirmed rates

---

### ❌ Q4: What's cost difference between 3 lbs actual vs 4 lbs DIM across all zones?
**Status**: **NO - Missing zone-specific rate data**

**What we have**:
- Zone distribution showing where DIM-affected packages go ✅
- Brycen's "only 1 lb, not significant" claim to counter ✅

**What we're missing**:
- ❌ Xparcel Ground rates: 3 lbs vs 4 lbs for Zones 1-8
- ❌ USPS GA rates: 3 lbs vs 4 lbs for Zones 1-8
- ❌ Zone-specific cost delta calculations

**Can we answer?**: NO - Cannot quantify "not significant" without actual rates

**Priority**: **🔴 HIGH** - Directly counters Brycen's objection to DIM waiver

**Blocker**: Need complete zone-based rate cards

---

### ⚠️ Q5: What's driving high cost on 250 FirstMile packages currently shipping?
**Status**: **PARTIAL - Can analyze, need context**

**What we have**:
- 250 packages on FirstMile XParcelExpedited ✅
- Xparcel Expedited rate: $12.30 (Zone 5, 3 lbs) ✅
- USPS GA rate: $9.13 (Zone 5, 3 lbs) ✅
- Cost difference: $3.17/package (35% more expensive) ✅

**What we're missing**:
- ❌ Why are they using Expedited? (customer requirement or lack of Ground option?)
- ❌ Service level needs (do these need 2-5 day vs 3-8 day delivery?)
- ❌ Xparcel Ground pricing to calculate potential savings

**Can we answer?**: PARTIAL - Can show the cost difference, but need context on why

**Estimated savings if converted to Ground**:
- 250 packages × $3.17 = **$792/month** (convert Expedited to Ground)

**Priority**: **🟡 MEDIUM** - Supporting detail, not main deal driver

**Action**: Ask Chase/Juan why these 250 are on Expedited
