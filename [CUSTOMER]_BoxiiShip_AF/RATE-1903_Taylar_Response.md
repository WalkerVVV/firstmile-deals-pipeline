## Strategic Analysis

### What Taylar Did:

1. **Targeted Lightweight Packages** (1-6 lbs) where Make Wellness volume concentrates
2. **Focused on Zones 1-4** (Regional delivery) where most packages ship
3. **Aggressive 2-3 lb reductions**: Largest percentage savings where volume is highest
4. **Maintained Zone 5-8 pricing** for cross-country shipments (limited volume impact)
5. **Created competitive separation** from UPS pricing that Make Wellness is paying

### Impact on Win-Back Strategy:

**Volume Distribution** (estimated from historical data):
- 1-12 oz: ~30% of volume → Minimal rate changes (maintaining margin)
- 13-16 oz: ~20% of volume → Small reductions (-$0.04 to -$0.12)
- 2-3 lbs: ~35% of volume → **LARGEST REDUCTIONS** (-$0.41 to -$0.78)
- 4-6 lbs: ~15% of volume → Moderate reductions (-$0.17 to -$0.77)

**Projected Savings for Make Wellness**:
- Current UPS overpayment: **$45K-$50K/week** vs old FirstMile rates
- With these new aggressive rates: **Additional 3-8% savings** on new rate card
- Total potential savings vs UPS: **~$52K-$58K/week** (estimated)

### Next Steps for Nate/BoxiiShip:

1. **Present New Rate Card** to Make Wellness
2. **Calculate Actual Savings** using Make Wellness's real volume distribution
3. **Emphasize Service Recovery**: April issues resolved, no ACI-WS routing to TX/AZ
4. **Highlight Cost Pain**: They've paid **$1.17M-$1.3M extra** since July (26 weeks)
5. **Urgency Message**: Every week they delay = **$52K-$58K** lost to UPS
