- Daily volume: 5,000 packages/day
- Service level: Xparcel Priority (1-3 day)
- Annual revenue: $7.2M

**Customer Impact**:
- 700+ orders delivered outside SLA window

### Technical Resolution (May 1, 2025)

**Fixes Implemented**:
- ✅ **FAST Group Network Integration**: FirstMile, ACI, and Sindel working together as unified network

  - 90-95% delivery by Day 3 for Xparcel Priority/Exp Plus
  - 90-95% delivery by Day 5 for Xparcel Expedited
- ✅ Performance stabilized to pre-April levels
- ✅ 5+ months of stable performance (May-October 2025)

**Critical Gap**: Make Wellness left in July 2025 before seeing May improvements
