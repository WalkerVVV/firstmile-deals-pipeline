## Engagement Strategy

### Optimal Timing
- **Best Window:** Q1 2026 (post-peak season review)
- **Alternative:** Q4 2025 (peak planning, but operations team busy)
- **Hook:** New CEO's first 100 days = vendor audits and operational reviews

### Outreach Approach
1. **LinkedIn InMail** to Maggie Gauger (CEO-level value prop)
2. **Corporate Call** to Gap Inc. switchboard for supply chain contact
3. **Chris Blakeslee** outreach for warm introduction (if reachable)
4. **Industry Events** where Gap Inc. speaks (retail logistics conferences)

### Discovery Questions
1. What percentage of customer complaints relate to shipping/delivery?
2. Can you share annual parcel volume and average cost per package?
3. What are Maggie's top 3 operational priorities in first year?
4. Who owns carrier contract negotiations (Athleta or Gap Inc.)?
5. Are there upcoming contract renewals we should be aware of?

**Deal Challenges:**
