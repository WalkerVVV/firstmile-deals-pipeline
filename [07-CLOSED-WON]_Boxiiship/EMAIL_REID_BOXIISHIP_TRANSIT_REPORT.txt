Hi Reid,

I wanted to follow up on the issues and data you raised regarding BoxiiShip System Beauty TX. I've received detailed updates from Stephen Lineberry (our Senior Partnership Manager), and the news is positive across the board.

Here's what's been resolved and what the data shows:

---

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLUTIONS

### 1. Manual Encoding/Sorting Issue - FULLY RESOLVED
- The sorting machine malfunction from earlier this summer has been completely fixed
- Parcels are now sorted, encoded, and cleared from the docks within 24 hours
- Ongoing monitoring is in place to catch any anomalies

### 2. Tracking Visibility & Mis-Sorts - CLARIFIED
- For the tracking file you shared: The labels were not cancelled, but they were never physically received or scanned into our system
- We're running routine "No First Scan" reports to catch parcels not moving within SLE
- Direct communication with client ops teams ensures no freight is being held back at nodes
- These steps have helped reduce complaints

## üìä TRANSIT REPORT FINDINGS (July - September 2025)

Stephen provided the full transit report for BoxiiShip Beauty Logistics LLC. Here are the highlights:

**Performance Summary:**
- **Average days in transit: 2.96 days**
- **99.9% delivered by Day 8**
- **97% delivered by Day 5**

**Service Usage:**
- Ground service is the slowest (as expected)
- DHL Expedited (under 1 lb) is your most frequently used service
- SLEs look strong overall, except for USPS GA over 1 lb in July/August

**Label-to-Scan Timing:**
- Average: 1.03 days (slightly higher than our network average)
- **Max had the longest delay to first scan in August (12.23 days)**
  - **Why:** TSA Known Shipper status was unknown after the move to the new Dallas Fort Worth location, which caused a brief period of delay and holding for Max packages
  - This has since been resolved with TSA

**Bottom line:** Strong performance overall with 99.9% on-time delivery and fast transit times averaging under 3 days.
