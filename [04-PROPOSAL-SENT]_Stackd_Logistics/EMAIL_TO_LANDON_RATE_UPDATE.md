## Peak Season Question ⚡

Quick question while we have rates in review: **What has DHL told you about Peak Season 2025 fees?**

I want to make sure our FirstMile proposal accounts for any peak surcharges you're currently facing or expecting from DHL. This will help us show you an apples-to-apples comparison and potentially position FirstMile to help you minimize peak season fee impact.

**Specifically interested in**:
- Peak season date range (Nov-Dec typically?)
- Per-package surcharge amounts
- Residential delivery surcharges
- Any other seasonal fees DHL has mentioned

---

## Let's Meet Tuesday Next Week

Once rates are finalized, I'd like to walk you through the proposal and answer any questions. How does **Tuesday, October 8th** work for you?

**Proposed times** (30 minutes):
- 10:00 AM CST
- 2:00 PM CST
- 3:00 PM CST

**Or use my scheduler**: [Insert Calendly Link]

We'll cover:
1. **Rate card review** - Zone-by-zone pricing for your weight tiers
2. **Service level comparison** - Xparcel Ground vs Expedited vs Priority
3. **Savings analysis** - Your current DHL/UPS costs vs FirstMile projection
4. **Peak season strategy** - How FirstMile can help minimize seasonal fee impact
5. **Implementation timeline** - Next steps if you'd like to move forward

---

## Why I'm Excited About This

Based on your volume profile:
- **89.9% of your packages are under 1 lb** - our sweet spot for savings
- **Heavy UPS 2nd Day** - Xparcel Expedited is a perfect alternative
- **3PL operation** - you have the flexibility to test and scale
- **Peak season coming** - great timing to lock in rates and avoid surcharges

Looking forward to showing you what we've built!

**Next Steps**:
1. Confirm volume numbers look correct (or let me know adjustments)
2. Share DHL peak season fee info if you have it
3. Pick a time Tuesday for our proposal review

Any questions in the meantime, just holler.

Best,
