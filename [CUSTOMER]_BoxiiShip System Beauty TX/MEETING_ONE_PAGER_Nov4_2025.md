# BoxiiShip ACI Crisis - Meeting One-Pager
**Date**: November 4, 2025 @ 1:00 PM | **Attendees**: Lindsey, Brock, ACI Team, Brett Walker

## 🚨 THE CRITICAL NUMBER: 89

**Reid provided 110 tracking numbers on Nov 3**
- **89 are from October 6** (80.9%)
- **89 still show "Shipment info received"** (100% of Oct 6)
- **ZERO scanned by carrier in 28 days**
- **ZERO delivered from Oct 6**

**Translation**: Carrier created electronic manifests but **NEVER physically accepted packages**. After 28 days, packages still in limbo with unknown physical location.

## WHAT HAPPENED: OCT 6 TIMELINE

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Oct 6** | 1,990 shipments tendered (4.5x normal) | Carrier overwhelmed |
| **Oct 6** | 97.9% never scanned | Complete acceptance failure |
| **Oct 6-9** | 0-24% delivery rates | 3-day crisis period |
| **Oct 13** | 79.2% delivery rate | Recovery milestone |
| **Nov 3** | Reid's 89 packages: 0% scanned | STILL NO RECOVERY |

## TOP 3 QUESTIONS FOR ACI

1. **Where are Reid's 89 packages RIGHT NOW?** (BoxiiShip facility? ACI hub? Lost? RTS?)

2. **Why ZERO scans in 28 days?** (Capacity? System error? Rejected but not notified?)

3. **What's the recovery plan for TODAY?** (Locate, scan, deliver timeline?)

## BUSINESS IMPACT

### Customer Risk
- **Reid**: Under extreme pressure from SE Asia customers for 28 days
- **BoxiiShip**: Cannot fulfill eCommerce commitments
- **Churn Risk**: CRITICAL - relationship depends on swift resolution

### Financial Risk
- **Service Credits**: 89+ packages × 28 days beyond SLA = significant cost
- **Future Revenue**: $10,080 annual ACI Direct opportunity BLOCKED
- **Carrier Trust**: May require backup carrier for future volume

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE TODAY

### Must Have
✅ Physical location of 89 packages identified
✅ Root cause explanation (acceptance failure on Oct 6)
✅ Realistic delivery timeline for 89 packages
✅ Service credit calculation

### Should Have
✅ Prevention protocol (volume caps, advance warnings)
✅ Carrier capacity limits documented
✅ Backup carrier plan for overflow
