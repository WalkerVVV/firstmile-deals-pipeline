## EMAIL BODY

Landon,

**Your Stackd Logistics Xparcel rates are done.** Just received final approval from our Sales/Pricing team (JIRA RATE-1897).

I've got your custom 41-tier pricing matrix covering Xparcel Ground, Expedited, and Priority across your full weight range (1 oz - 10+ lbs). Based on your 8,957 shipment data, this is optimized for your lightweight concentration (89.9% under 1 lb).

**Let's meet to review ASAP.**

**My availability this week:**
- **Tuesday, Oct 8**: 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, or 3:00 PM CST
- **Wednesday, Oct 9**: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM CST (flexible)
- **Thursday, Oct 10**: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM or 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM CST

**What we'll cover** (30-45 minutes):
1. Rate card walkthrough (National & Select Networks)
2. Service level comparison (Ground vs Expedited vs Priority)
3. Volume assumptions validation (your 96% Ground, 4% Expedited mix)
4. Peak Season 2025 strategy (vs DHL fees)
5. ShipHero integration timeline

**A few quick questions to prep:**
- What has DHL communicated about their Peak Season 2025 fees?
- Any changes to your Q4 volume projections?
- Current integration: API or web portal?

Which time works best for you?

Best,
