## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Caputron currently ships 5,546 packages monthly from Manhattan using USPS Ground Advantage with flat nationwide pricing. This analysis reveals a 25-30% cost savings opportunity through FirstMile's Xparcel zone-optimized multi-carrier solution.

**Key Finding**: Manhattan's proximity to 55% of US population creates massive zone skip advantages that USPS flat rates cannot capture.

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Volume Profile
- Monthly packages: 5,546
- Under 1 lb: 73% of volume
- Peak weight: 15 oz (745 packages/week)
- Average weight: 12.8 oz
- Primary carriers: USPS GA (under 5 lbs), UPS Ground (5+ lbs)

### Current Rate Structure - USPS Ground Advantage

|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1-5 oz | $4.08-$4.76 | Same price to Zone 2 or Zone 8 |
