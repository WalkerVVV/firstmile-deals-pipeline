## Caputron Medical - Neurostimulation & 3PL Services
*Generated: June 30, 2025 | Stage: [03-RATE-CREATION] | Est. Value: $600K-$1.2M*

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE KILL SHOT
**The One Thing That Closes This Deal:**
Caputron's 3PL arm is growing but their 2-10 person team can't scale past 500 shipments/day. FirstMile's Xparcel can automate their carrier selection, eliminate signature disputes, and handle their medical device compliance requirements - all while cutting costs 15-25%.

**Pain Score: 7/10** - They're feeling growth constraints NOW.

---

## üìä THE NUMBERS THAT MATTER

### Current Shipping Profile:
- **Volume**: Est. 200-400 packages/day (scaling to 1,000+)
- **Carriers**: UPS, DHL, USPS (no optimization)
- **Processing**: 1-3 days (too slow for medical)
- **Free Shipping Threshold**: $50 (eating margins)

### FirstMile Opportunity:
- **Potential Savings**: $180K-$360K annually
- **SLA Improvement**: 1-3 days ‚Üí Same-day processing
- **Carrier Optimization**: 3 carriers ‚Üí 15+ with Xparcel
- **Signature Automation**: Save $3-5 per package

## üî• THREE HOOKS TO LAND THIS FISH

1. **The 3PL Growth Hook**: "Robin, your 3PL service is brilliant but your 10-person team is the bottleneck. Xparcel automates what takes 3 people to do manually."

2. **The Medical Compliance Hook**: "With neurostimulation devices, one lost package = regulatory nightmare. Our signature confirmation is bulletproof."

3. **The Refurbishment Hook**: "Your 90-day returns with refurbishment? We can cut return shipping costs by 40% using regional carriers."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPETITIVE INTEL & RISKS

### They're Vulnerable Because:
- Small team = can't scale operations
- Manual processes = errors at volume
- Generic carriers = no optimization
- Optional signatures = dispute risks

### Competition Positioning:
- ShipBob/Fulfillment by Amazon can't handle medical devices
- Traditional 3PLs too expensive for their size
- We're the only ones with medical + 3PL expertise

### Closing Risks:
- ‚ùå Team size might resist new technology
- ‚ùå Comfortable with current carriers
- ‚úÖ But growth pressure will force change
