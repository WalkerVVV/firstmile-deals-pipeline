## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: IN-TRANSIT PERFORMANCE

### The Problem That Led to Cancellation

While **delivered performance** looked excellent (99.9%), the **in-transit visibility** revealed major service issues:

**In-Transit Status (Sep 30 snapshot)**:
- Total In-Transit: **1,676 shipments**
- Within SLA Window: 1,042 (62.2%)
- **Outside SLA Window (Late): 634 (37.8%)** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Total SLA Misses**: 43 packages
- 1 delivered outside SLA
- **42 in-transit outside SLA window** (already late even though not delivered)

### Root Cause Indicators

From SLA Misses analysis (Tab 8 of Sep 30 report):
1. **Top 20 ZIPs by Misses** - identified problematic destination clusters
2. **High-Zone Issues** - Zones 7-8 struggling to meet 8-day Ground window
3. **Linehaul and Induction Cadence** - delays in lane performance

**Recommended Actions from Sep 30 Report**:
- Evaluate ZIP-limit: Ground ‚Üí Expedited for problematic ZIP clusters
- Investigate linehaul and induction cadence for affected lanes
- Consider Expedited for Zones 7-8 on high-risk lanes

## Notes & Assumptions

**Assumptions**:
- Cancellation driven by 37.8% in-transit late rate (Sep 30 report flagged this)
- Customer likely frustrated by lack of proactive resolution after Sep 30 report
- Service issues concentrated in Zones 7-8 and specific ZIP clusters
- Customer may be evaluating alternative carriers or already switching

**Business Rules**:
- SLA compliance calculated on **delivered** packages only
- In-transit packages outside SLA window are "late" even if not delivered
- FirstMile standard: 95%+ compliance = Exceeds, 90-94% = Meets, <90% = Below

**Critical Success Factors for Recovery**:
1. Fast response (meeting within 48 hours)
2. Transparent root cause analysis
3. Concrete service improvement commitments
4. Proactive monitoring and communication going forward
