**To**: Landon @ Stackd Logistics
**Subject**: FirstMile Xparcel Proposal - Quick Check-In

Hi Landon,

Following up on the Xparcel rates we sent two weeks ago showing 38% cost savings.

Quick questions:
1. Have you had a chance to review the proposal?
2. Any questions about the rate structure or service levels?
3. Would a quick 15-minute call help clarify anything?

Happy to walk through any details.

Best,
Brett Walker
FirstMile
