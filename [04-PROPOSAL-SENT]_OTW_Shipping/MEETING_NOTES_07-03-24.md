# OTW SHIPPING - MEETING NOTES
*Meeting Date: July 3, 2024 @ 11:30 AM*

## ATTENDEES
- Brett Walker (FirstMile)
- Brock (FirstMile)  
- Nick (OTW Shipping)

## NICK'S EXACT REQUIREMENTS

### On Price/Service Balance:
"The top two things are price and service, obviously. So it has to be something that's going to save our clients money. Has to be something that isn't going to compromise service level."

### On Rate Transparency:
"It's $3.10 but then it's got a, if it's this, it's 12% fuel surcharge. If it's this, it's 17... at the end of the day, we need to advertise something to our clients."

### On Carrier Performance:
"So like ACI logistics, colloquially, I haven't heard great things about them... you guys have the data."

"If your rate sheet has one carrier who's $3.10 starting, but then everyone else is starting it 380... and that one carrier is just terrible."

### On Claims Process:
"DHL e-commerce is useless. Trying to do claims... You need to sign over their firstborn son to get anything back."

### On First-Mile Scanning:
"If a carrier is not having issues scanning packages in... we have on camera that we handed these batches off."

### On Reporting Needs:
"Having both would certainly not hurt... that initial rate sheet's good from a sales perspective. And then it's like, Hey, let me take a peek under the hood."
