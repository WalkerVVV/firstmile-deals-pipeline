## What Needs to Change

### 1. Original Deal (36466918934)
**Current (WRONG)**:
- Stage: [08] Closed Lost
- Implication: BoxiiShip is not a customer

**Should Be (CORRECT)**:
- Stage: [07] Started Shipping (active customer)
- Name: `BoxiiShip American Fork - 3PL Customer`
- Notes: Active customer, but lost Make Wellness volume to UPS

### 2. Win-Back Deal (45692064076)
**Current**:
- Name: `BoxiiShip American Fork - WIN-BACK CAMPAIGN 2025`

**Should Be (MORE SPECIFIC)**:
- Name: `BoxiiShip AF - Make Wellness Volume WIN-BACK 2025`
- Makes clear it's Make Wellness volume, not BoxiiShip customer

### 3. Local Folder Structure
**Current (WRONG)**:
```
[08-CLOSED-LOST]_BoxiiShip AF/    ‚Üê Implies they're not a customer
```

**Should Be (CORRECT)**:
```
Customer-BoxiiShip_AF/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Win-Back_Make_Wellness_2025/
```

## Corrective Actions Required

### HubSpot Updates

1. **Revert original deal AGAIN** (36466918934)
   - Move to [07] Started Shipping (active customer)
   - Update name to clarify they're active 3PL customer
   - Note: Lost Make Wellness volume to UPS, but still our customer

2. **Update win-back deal** (45692064076)
   - Clarify it's Make Wellness volume win-back
   - Keep in [04] Proposal Sent
   - Add context: Parent customer BoxiiShip AF is active

### Local Folder Reorganization

1. **Rename existing folder**:
   ```
   FROM: [08-CLOSED-LOST]_BoxiiShip AF
   TO:   Customer-BoxiiShip_AF
   ```

2. **Create win-back subfolder**:
   ```
   Customer-BoxiiShip_AF/Win-Back_Make_Wellness_2025/
   ```

3. **Organize materials**:
   - Customer profile and active business: Main folder
   - Make Wellness win-back campaign: Subfolder

## Business Context

**BoxiiShip American Fork** = 3PL customer who uses FirstMile
**Make Wellness** = BoxiiShip's customer (end shipper)
**UPS** = Competitor who won Make Wellness volume

### Revenue Structure:
```
Make Wellness (shipper)
    ‚îî‚îÄ> BoxiiShip AF (3PL) ‚Üê OUR CUSTOMER
           ‚îî‚îÄ> FirstMile (carrier)
```

**What happened**: Make Wellness moved volume to UPS directly, bypassing BoxiiShip AF

**Win-back goal**: Get Make Wellness back to BoxiiShip AF, who will use FirstMile

**Annual value**: $7.2M (Make Wellness volume through BoxiiShip)
