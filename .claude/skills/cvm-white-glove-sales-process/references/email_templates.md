## Stage 05 - Pre-Implementation Alignment

### Template: Volume Confirmation Email

**Subject**: Implementation Kickoff - Volume Confirmation

```
Hi [Customer Name],

As we prepare for our implementation kickoff with [Implementation Team Lead], I wanted to level-set on what we discussed during the sales process:

**Test Period (Weeks 1-2)**:
- Volume: [X] packages/day ([Y]% of total commitment)
- Duration: 2 weeks from first pickup
- Success criteria: Transit performance, billing accuracy, operational fit

**Post-Test Ramp (Week 3+)**:
- Target volume: [Z] packages/day
- Ramp timing: Immediate upon successful test completion
- Annual commitment: [A] packages

[Implementation Team Lead] will be reaching out shortly to schedule training and coordinate logistics. I'll remain involved throughout implementation to ensure smooth execution.

Please confirm this aligns with your expectations, and let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

[Specific agreement from sales process]

[Implementation Team], can you confirm this aligns with what's been communicated in the implementation process?

## Stage 06 - Post-Test Ramp Enforcement

### Template: Performance Confirmation & Ramp Discussion

**Subject**: [Customer Name] - Test Period Complete, Let's Discuss Ramp

```
Hi [Customer Name],

We've now completed the 2-week test period (first shipment: [Date]), and I wanted to review performance and discuss the ramp to full volume.

**Test Period Performance**:
- Transit time: [X] days average ([Y]% on-time to commitment)
- Billing accuracy: [Z]% (no disputes or issues)
- Operational integration: [Smooth/Minor issues resolved/etc.]

Based on these results and our original agreement, we're ready to ramp to [Y] packages/day. 

Can we schedule a brief call this week to discuss the ramp timeline? I'd like to understand:
1. Are you satisfied with the test period performance?
2. What's the timeline for ramping to full volume?
3. What support do you need from our team to facilitate the ramp?

Looking forward to moving into the next phase together.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Template: Addressing Volume Shortfall (Consultative)

**Subject**: [Customer Name] - Following Up on Volume Ramp

```
Hi [Customer Name],

I wanted to follow up on our volume ramp discussion. We're currently on day [X] post-test, and I'm seeing volume at [Y] packages/day, which is below our agreed commitment of [Z] packages/day.

Before we dive into the "why," I want to first confirm: Are you satisfied with our performance during the test period? Specifically:
- Transit times: [Performance data]
- Billing accuracy: [Performance data]
- Operational integration: [Performance data]

If performance is meeting your expectations, I'd like to understand what's preventing the ramp. Some common situations I've seen:
- Operational bandwidth constraints
- Changes in business volume
- Internal approval processes
- Integration or technical issues

Which of these (or something else) is the primary factor? Once I understand the root cause, I can work with our team to provide whatever support is needed to get us to the committed volume.

Let's schedule 15 minutes this week to discuss. I'm committed to making this work.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Template: Addressing "Let's Wait and See" Delay Tactics

**Subject**: [Customer Name] - Establishing Clear Next Steps

```
Hi [Customer Name],

I appreciate your desire to be thoughtful about the volume ramp. At the same time, I want to make sure we have clear milestones and decision points rather than an indefinite "wait and see" approach.

Here's what I'd like to propose:

**Option 1**: Ramp to [X]% of committed volume by [Date], then full volume by [Date]
**Option 2**: Extend test period for [Y] additional weeks with specific performance thresholds that, if met, trigger the ramp
**Option 3**: Revisit the original commitment and establish a new baseline that reflects current business realities

Which of these approaches makes the most sense for your situation? Or is there a different path you'd prefer?

I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both sides, but I also need to understand what success looks like from your perspective so we can plan accordingly.

Let's discuss this week.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Template: Quarterly Volume Audit & Expansion Discussion

**Subject**: [Customer Name] - Q[X] Volume Review & Expansion Opportunities

```
Hi [Customer Name],

As we close out Q[X], I wanted to share our quarterly volume analysis and discuss opportunities for the coming quarter.
