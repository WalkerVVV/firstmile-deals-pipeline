**Subject**: BoxiiShip AF - Supply Status Check (Make Wellness Relaunch)

Hi Jim,

Quick check on supplies for the **BoxiiShip American Fork facility** as they're ramping up Make Wellness volume this week:

**Immediate Need**:
1. **Gaylords**: Have the Gaylords been delivered to BoxiiShip AF?
2. **Pallets**: Pallet delivery status?
3. **Additional supplies**: Do we need to send more Gaylords/pallets for the 10k-30k packages/month ramp-up?

**Timeline**: Make Wellness is starting shipments **this week**, so Nate needs confirmation that supplies are in place.

**Volume Context**:
- **Starting volume**: 10k packages/month
- **Target volume**: 20k-30k packages/month by Week 4
- **Location**: BoxiiShip American Fork, Utah

Can you confirm delivery status and let me know if we need to send additional supplies?

Thanks!
Brett
