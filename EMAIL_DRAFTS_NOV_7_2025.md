## EMAIL 2: Upstate Prep - Brandon DHL Follow-up

**To**: Brandon
**Subject**: Quick Check - DHL Situation

**Draft**:

Hey Brandon,

Hope all is well.

Following up as we received a message from DHL asking us to disengage saying that you are a DHL customer. I didn't notice any DHL shipments other than 6 expedited on the shipment data you shared with us and wanted to check in with you as DHL is one of our largest partners. Now if we're working on an account then they back off and vice versa.

Can you let me know the status there? What's the story?

Best,
Brett Walker
