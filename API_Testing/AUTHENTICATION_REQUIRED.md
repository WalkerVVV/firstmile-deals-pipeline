# FirstMile Tracking API - Authentication IS Required

## Summary

**The FirstMile Tracking API at `https://trackingapi.firstmile.com/Tracking/v1/{trackingNumber}` DOES require authentication.**

We tested and confirmed:
- ❌ Direct API access without auth → **401 Unauthorized**
- ❌ With TechPartnerId parameter only → **401 Unauthorized**
- ❌ Public tracking portal (`/track/`) → **404 Not Found**

## What Your IT Might Mean

When IT said "you don't need authentication," they might be referring to:

### 1. Different Access Method

They might use a **different tracking method** such as:

**A) FirstMile Customer Portal (Web UI)**
- Login at https://www.firstmile.com or similar
- Use web interface to look up tracking
- No API credentials needed because it's manual

**B) Integrated System**
- Your warehouse/shipping system might already have API credentials built-in
- You don't see the credentials because they're pre-configured
- The system handles authentication in the background

**C) Email/File-Based Tracking**
- FirstMile sends you tracking update files (CSV/EDI)
- No API calls needed
- Just read files from FTP/email

### 2. Credentials Exist But IT Didn't Realize

Possibilities:
- **API key exists** but IT calls it something else ("access code", "partner ID", "client secret")
- **IP Whitelisting** - Your office IP is whitelisted, so IT thinks "no auth needed"
- **Embedded widget** - IT uses an iframe/widget that FirstMile provides

### 3. They Meant a Different API

FirstMile might have multiple ways to track:
- **REST API** (what we're trying) - requires Bearer token
- **SOAP API** (legacy) - might use different auth
- **Public lookup** - might not exist or be at different URL

## Confirmed API Requirements

According to FirstMile's official API documentation:

```
Endpoint: GET /Tracking/v1/{trackingNumber}
Security: Bearer
Required: Authorization header with JWT token
```

**Example successful call would look like:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  https://trackingapi.firstmile.com/Tracking/v1/9261290339737604364714
```

## What You Need from IT

**Please ask your IT team for ONE of these:**

### Option A: API Credentials
```
Subject: FirstMile API Credentials Needed

Hi [IT],

To use the FirstMile Tracking REST API, I need:

1. Bearer JWT token OR API key
2. TechPartnerId (if applicable)
3. Any other authentication credentials

Endpoint: https://trackingapi.firstmile.com/Tracking/v1/{trackingNumber}

Can you provide these or point me to where they're stored?

Thanks!
```

### Option B: Alternative Tracking Method
```
Subject: How Do We Currently Track FirstMile Shipments?

Hi [IT],

You mentioned we don't need authentication for FirstMile tracking.
Can you show me:

1. What URL/system you use to track shipments
2. How you would track these numbers:
   - 9261290339737604364714
   - 9261290339737604467729
   - 9400136208303372628595

I want to make sure I'm using the same method you're using.

Thanks!
```

### Option C: Direct Access
```
Subject: Can You Track These FirstMile Shipments?

Hi [IT],

Can you look up tracking info for these shipments?

- 9261290339737604364714
- 9261290339737604467729
- 9261290339737604467446
- 9400136208303372628595
- 9261290339737604478176

I need to see what information is available and how you access it.

Thanks!
```

## Your 5 Tracking Numbers

Ready to test once you get credentials:

1. `9261290339737604364714`
2. `9261290339737604467729`
3. `9261290339737604467446`
4. `9400136208303372628595`
5. `9261290339737604478176`

## Next Steps

1. **Ask IT for clarification** (use email templates above)
2. **Get JWT token or alternative method**
3. **Run:** `python test_batch.py` with credentials
4. **Get full tracking details** for all 5 shipments

## Can't Get Credentials?

If IT truly doesn't have API access, you might need to:

1. **Contact FirstMile directly** to request API access
2. **Use FirstMile's customer portal** (manual web lookup)
3. **Request tracking reports** via email/FTP from FirstMile
4. **Ask your account manager** to set up API access

---

**Bottom Line:** The REST API endpoint 100% requires authentication. Your IT either has credentials they're not aware are "authentication," or they use a different tracking method entirely.
