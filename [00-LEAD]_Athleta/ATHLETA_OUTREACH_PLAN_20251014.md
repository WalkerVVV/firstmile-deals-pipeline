## Outreach Strategy

### Approach 1: LinkedIn InMail to Maggie Gauger (CEO-Level)
**Timing:** Week of October 21 (after initial research complete)
**Tone:** Executive, strategic, pain point-focused

**Message Framework:**
```
Subject: Athleta Delivery Reliability - $10M+ Savings Opportunity

Hi Maggie,

Congratulations on your new role at Athleta. I've been following your customer experience focus and wanted to reach out about a significant operational opportunity.

FirstMile works with activewear brands like [EXAMPLE BRAND] to solve the exact delivery reliability challenges Athleta is experiencing:
• 50% order failure rates
• Multi-carrier coordination complexity
• Transit time inconsistencies

Our Xparcel solution consolidates your 6-carrier mix into one dynamic routing platform, delivering:
• 25-35% cost savings ($10-14M annually on $40M spend)
• Single integration eliminates warehouse-carrier coordination issues
• Proactive exception management improves customer experience

Given your operational improvement mandate, I'd love to schedule 15 minutes to discuss how FirstMile could support Athleta's turnaround.

What works for a brief call in the next two weeks?

Best regards,
Brett Walker
FirstMile
```

**Follow-Up:** If no response in 7 days, send follow-up InMail or phone call

### Approach 2: Corporate Switchboard to Supply Chain
**Timing:** Week of October 21 (parallel with LinkedIn outreach)
**Method:** Cold call to Gap Inc. main line (415) 427-0100

**Script:**
```
"Hi, I'm Brett Walker with FirstMile. I'm looking to connect with the person who oversees carrier contracts and logistics operations for Athleta. Could you point me in the right direction?"

[If they ask for more details:]
"We work with activewear brands to consolidate multi-carrier operations and reduce shipping costs. I've analyzed Athleta's shipping profile and identified a significant cost savings opportunity - around $10-14 million annually. I'd like to discuss this with the appropriate supply chain or logistics leader."
```

**Goal:** Get name, title, and email of supply chain decision-maker

### Approach 3: Chris Blakeslee Warm Introduction
**Timing:** If mutual connection found or direct outreach appropriate
**Method:** LinkedIn message or email (if obtainable)

**Message Framework:**
```
Subject: Athleta Operational Improvements - Carrier Consolidation

Hi Chris,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out because FirstMile works with activewear brands on shipping optimization, and I noticed you recently led Athleta.

I've been researching Athleta's delivery challenges (documented 50% order failure rates) and identified a $10-14M savings opportunity through carrier consolidation. Given Maggie Gauger's operational improvement focus, this seems like an opportune time to introduce FirstMile.

Would you be open to making an introduction to Maggie or the appropriate supply chain leader at Gap Inc.?

Happy to share our activewear client case studies.

Best,
Brett Walker
FirstMile
```

### Approach 4: Industry Events & Conferences

## Risk Mitigation

### Challenge 1: Declining Revenue May Limit Budget
**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize cost savings (self-funding through reduced shipping spend)
- ROI-focused messaging ($10-14M savings vs implementation cost)
- Pilot program option to prove value before full commitment

### Challenge 2: Gap Inc. Centralized Logistics Slows Decision
**Mitigation:**
- Target both Athleta (Maggie) and Gap Inc. corporate (supply chain VP)
- Build dual-track relationships
- Emphasize brand-specific pain points (Athleta's 50% failure rate)

### Challenge 3: Supply Chain Contact Not Yet Identified
**Mitigation:**
- Multi-pronged outreach (CEO, corporate switchboard, LinkedIn search)
- Leverage mutual connections for warm introductions
- Industry events for face-to-face networking

### Challenge 4: Leadership Transition May Delay Vendor Evaluations
**Mitigation:**
- Frame as "first 100 days quick win" opportunity
- Q1 2026 timing aligns with post-peak operational reviews
- New CEO = openness to change and vendor audits
