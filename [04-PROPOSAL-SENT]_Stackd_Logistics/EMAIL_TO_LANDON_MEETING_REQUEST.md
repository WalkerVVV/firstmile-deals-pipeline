**Subject**: Stackd Logistics - Your Xparcel Rates Are Ready

---

Landon,

Your Xparcel rates are ready, and I'm excited to walk you through what we found.

I've built out a complete savings analysis based on your actual shipping data, and the opportunity here is compelling. Your weight profile fits perfectly with where FirstMile excels, and I think you're going to like what you see.

I've put together a professional workbook that breaks down everything - savings by weight, by zone, implementation roadmap, the whole picture. But I'd rather show you than tell you.

Can we get 30 minutes on the calendar this week? I'm wide open Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday - your pick.

Let me know what works.

Brett
