## 🎯 THE DIM WEIGHT PROBLEM

### Current Situation (Without 1 Cu Ft Rule)

**Juggy Tumbler Example**:
- Actual weight: **3 lbs**
- Box: 11.5 × 9 × 5.5 in = **569 cubic inches**
- DIM weight calculation: 569 ÷ 139 = **4.09 lbs** → rounds to **4 lbs billable**
- **Impact**: Billed at 4 lbs instead of actual 3 lbs (+33% weight tier increase)

**Current Rates (from Tinoco's platform)**:
- USPS Ground Advantage (Zone 5, 3 lbs): **$9.13**
- USPS Ground Advantage (Zone 5, 4 lbs DIM): **Est. $10.50+** (need to confirm)
- FirstMile Xparcel Expedited (Zone 5, 3 lbs): **$12.30**

### Why This Matters

**ACI DIM Rules** (Standard for carriers):
- DIM divisor: **139** for all packages
- Threshold: No cubic foot exemption
- Result: 569 ÷ 139 = 4.09 lbs billable

**FirstMile 1 Cu Ft Rule** (if waived):
- Packages **under 1 cubic foot** use actual weight
- Juggy tumbler box: **0.33 cu ft** (qualifies for exemption)
- Result: Billed at **3 lbs actual** instead of 4 lbs DIM

**Savings per package** (if DIM waived):
- Current: $10.50 @ 4 lbs DIM
- With waiver: $9.13 @ 3 lbs actual
- Savings: **~$1.37 per package** (estimated)

## 📊 BRYCEN'S PLD ANALYSIS (Internal FirstMile Review)

### MexiStuff Analysis
- **31% of volume**: Would NOT DIM up (actual weight = billable weight)
- **33% of volume**: Would DIM up by 1 lb (e.g., 3 lbs actual → 4 lbs billable)
- **25% of volume**: Would DIM up by 9-10 lbs (but shipped via USPS GA, which has same DIM rules)

### Juggy Analysis
- **7% of volume**: Would NOT DIM up (actual weight = billable weight)
- **83% of volume**: Would DIM up by 1 lb ⚠️ **MAJORITY OF VOLUME**
- **6% of volume**: Would DIM up by 2 lbs

**Brycen's Conclusion**:
> "Most packages only DIM up by 1 lb, so the rate difference should not be significant enough to justify a DIM waiver."

## 🔍 OUR ANALYSIS (Based on Fresh PLD Data)

### Data We Now Have
- **Juggy**: 6,391 shipments (Sept 9 - Nov 6, 2025)
- **MexiStuff**: 3,283 shipments (same period)
- **Weight data**: 100% complete
- **Dimensions**: 100% complete
- **Cost data**: MISSING (waiting on Juggy pricing)

### Critical Questions to Answer

1. **How many Juggy packages are actually affected by DIM weight?**
   - Need to calculate DIM weight for all 6,391 shipments
   - Compare actual weight vs DIM weight (569 ÷ 139 = 4.09 lbs)
   - Identify packages where DIM > actual

2. **What's the actual cost impact of the 1 lb DIM increase?**
   - Current: Billed at 4 lbs DIM
   - With waiver: Billed at 3 lbs actual
   - Need rate card for Zone 5 (3 lbs vs 4 lbs pricing)

3. **Does this justify a DIM waiver request to FirstMile?**
   - If 83% of Juggy volume DIMs up by 1 lb = **5,304 packages** affected
   - Monthly impact: ~2,652 packages DIMing up
   - Need cost differential to calculate monthly savings

## 💰 RATE COMPARISON (Current vs FirstMile)

### Known Rates (Zone 5)

**Current USPS Ground Advantage**:
- 3 lbs actual: **$9.13** ✅ CONFIRMED
- 4 lbs DIM: **$10.50** (estimated, need to confirm)

**FirstMile Xparcel Expedited**:
- 3 lbs: **$12.30** ✅ CONFIRMED
- 4 lbs: **$13.50** (estimated, need to confirm)

**FirstMile Xparcel Ground** (need to request):
- 3 lbs: **$? (likely $8.50-$9.00 range)**
- 4 lbs: **$? (likely $9.50-$10.00 range)**

### Critical Gap: Xparcel Ground Pricing

**Current comparison is incomplete**:
- USPS GA vs Xparcel **Expedited** (not apples-to-apples)
- Xparcel Expedited is 2-5 day service (faster than USPS GA 3-8 days)
- Need **Xparcel Ground** rates to compare properly

**Request to Chase/Juan**:
- Get Xparcel Ground pricing for Zones 1-8, 1-5 lbs
- Get complete USPS GA rate card (confirm 4 lb rate)
- Clarify if FirstMile 1 cu ft rule applies to Tinoco account

## 🎯 DIM WEIGHT WAIVER ANALYSIS

### Arguments FOR DIM Waiver

1. **High Volume Impact**:
   - 83% of Juggy volume (5,304 packages) DIMs up by 1 lb
   - Monthly: ~2,652 packages affected
   - Annual: ~31,824 packages affected

2. **Product Characteristics**:
   - Tumbler box: 0.33 cu ft (well under 1 cu ft threshold)
   - Standard product size (not oversized/bulky)
   - Actual weight accurately reflects shipping cost

3. **Competitive Pressure**:
   - USPS GA doesn't penalize this product as heavily
   - Customer may resist FirstMile if DIM costs increase
   - Could lose deal to USPS incumbency

### Arguments AGAINST DIM Waiver (Brycen's Position)

1. **Modest DIM Impact**:
   - Only 1 lb increase for 83% of volume
   - Rate differential not "significant" (need to quantify)
   - MexiStuff has similar DIM patterns

2. **Standard Industry Practice**:
   - All carriers use DIM weight (139 divisor)
   - FirstMile shouldn't waive policy without strong justification
   - Sets precedent for other customers

3. **Comparison to USPS GA**:
   - MexiStuff 25% DIM up 9-10 lbs on USPS GA
   - USPS applies same DIM rules
   - Customer already dealing with DIM on current carrier

### Our Recommendation: **NEEDS MORE DATA**

**Cannot make informed decision without**:
1. Actual cost differential (3 lbs vs 4 lbs rates)
2. Xparcel Ground pricing (proper comparison to USPS GA)
3. Total monthly savings if waiver granted
4. Competitive landscape (is USPS waiving DIM for this customer?)

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Data Collection (Priority 1)

**From Chase/Juan**:
- [ ] Complete USPS GA rate card (Zones 1-8, 1-5 lbs)
- [ ] Confirm Zone 5, 4 lb USPS GA rate (currently estimated at $10.50)
- [ ] FirstMile Xparcel Ground rate card (not just Expedited)
- [ ] Clarify if 1 cu ft rule is standard or negotiable for Tinoco

**From Internal (Brycen/FirstMile Pricing)**:
- [ ] FirstMile policy on DIM waivers (under what conditions?)
- [ ] Precedent: Have we granted DIM waivers before? For whom?
- [ ] Competitive intelligence: Is USPS waiving DIM for Tinoco?

### Analysis Scripts to Run (Priority 2)

**Once we have pricing data**:

1. **Calculate DIM Weight for All Shipments**:
   ```python
   # For each package:
   # 1. Parse dimensions (L × W × H)
   # 2. Calculate cubic inches
   # 3. Calculate DIM weight (cubic_inches ÷ 139)
   # 4. Compare to actual weight
   # 5. Identify billable weight (max of actual or DIM)
   ```

2. **Build Cost Comparison Model**:
   ```python
   # For each package:
   # 1. Apply USPS GA rate (using billable weight)
   # 2. Apply Xparcel Ground rate (with DIM)
   # 3. Apply Xparcel Ground rate (without DIM, if waiver granted)
   # 4. Calculate savings: USPS vs Xparcel (no waiver) vs Xparcel (with waiver)
   ```

3. **DIM Impact Report**:
   - Packages where DIM > actual (count and %)
   - DIM increase distribution (0 lbs, 1 lb, 2 lbs, 3+ lbs)
   - Cost impact by DIM tier
   - Monthly/annual savings if waiver granted

## 🔬 HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS (Using Estimated Rates)

### Scenario 1: No DIM Waiver (Standard FirstMile Policy)

**Juggy Monthly Volume**: 3,196 packages
**Affected by DIM**: 83% = 2,653 packages DIM up to 4 lbs

**Current State (USPS GA)**:
- 2,653 packages × $10.50 (4 lbs DIM) = **$27,857/month**

**With FirstMile Xparcel Ground (no waiver)**:
- 2,653 packages × $9.75 (4 lbs DIM, estimated) = **$25,867/month**
- **Savings: $1,990/month** ($23,880 annually)

**FirstMile Win**: Modest savings even without waiver

---

### Scenario 2: DIM Waiver Granted (1 Cu Ft Rule Applies)

**With FirstMile Xparcel Ground (with waiver)**:
- 2,653 packages × $8.75 (3 lbs actual, estimated) = **$23,214/month**
- **Savings vs USPS: $4,643/month** ($55,716 annually)
- **Incremental savings from waiver: $2,653/month** ($31,836 annually)

**FirstMile Win**: Strong savings, competitive advantage

---

### Scenario 3: USPS Incumbency Risk (No FirstMile Move)

**If customer stays with USPS GA**:
- No savings for customer
- No revenue for FirstMile
- Lost opportunity: ~$280K annual revenue (3,196 × 12 × $7.30 avg rate)

**Risk Factor**: If FirstMile can't match USPS pricing due to DIM, deal stalls

**Analysis Created**: November 8, 2025
**Status**: PENDING RATE DATA
**Priority**: HIGH - DIM waiver decision blocks deal progression
**Estimated Deal Value**: $280K annual revenue at risk

## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Get Accurate Pricing**: Cannot proceed without Xparcel Ground rates
2. **Quantify DIM Impact**: Show Brycen actual cost impact, not just % of packages
3. **Strategic Decision**: DIM waiver may be worth $31K annual cost to win $280K deal
4. **Customer Communication**: Address DIM concern proactively and transparently
5. **Alternative Value**: If no waiver, emphasize other FirstMile advantages

**Bottom Line**: We need to make the business case to Brycen that granting the DIM waiver (or sharpening rates) is worth winning this customer. The 83% DIM impact is real, but need actual cost data to quantify the decision.
