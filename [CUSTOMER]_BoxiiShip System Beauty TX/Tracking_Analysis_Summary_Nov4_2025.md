## Analysis & Implications

### BLANK -MP Batch Performance (REVISED UNDERSTANDING)

**Initial Concern**: October 6 carrier acceptance failure based on incomplete data
**Actual Performance**: 98.2% delivery rate - EXCEEDS expectations

1. **Scope**: 1,332 packages analyzed with COMPLETE tracking data
2. **Success Rate**: 98.2% delivered (1,308 packages)
3. **Timeline**: Most packages delivered within normal transit windows (Oct 6 → Oct 14-21)
4. **Customer Impact**: MINIMAL - 98.2% successful delivery
5. **Comparison**: BLANK -MP (98.2%) OUTPERFORMED In-Transit -MP (92.9%)

### Data Quality Issue Identified

**Root Cause of Initial Confusion**:
- Reid's Excel data showed many BLANK -MP tracking numbers with empty/null status fields
- This was a **DATA COLLECTION issue**, NOT a carrier performance issue
- The actual tracking data from track.firstmile.com shows excellent performance
- 104 tracking numbers (1,436 - 1,332 = 104) may not have matched or had data collection gaps

---

## Revised Questions for 1pm ACI Meeting

1. **Data Collection**: Why did Reid's tracking data show blank statuses when actual tracking shows 98.2% delivered?
2. **Reporting Gap**: How did this create a false alarm about October 6 carrier acceptance?
3. **Process Improvement**: How can we prevent data collection gaps from creating false performance concerns?
4. **Celebration**: Should we recognize BLANK -MP batch as EXCEEDING performance targets (98.2% vs typical 92-95%)?
5. **System Reliability**: What caused the disconnect between internal tracking data and actual carrier updates?

---

## Recommendations (REVISED)

1. **Immediate**:
   - Share positive performance results with team
   - Identify and fix data collection gap that caused blank statuses in Reid's report

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review data sync between track.firstmile.com and internal reporting
   - Determine why 104 tracking numbers didn't appear in complete tracking data

3. **Prevention**:
   - Implement data validation to flag incomplete tracking status imports
   - Add automated comparison between internal data and live tracking

4. **Process**:
   - Verify tracking data completeness BEFORE raising performance concerns
   - Use live tracking data as source of truth, not cached/static reports

5. **Recognition**:
   - Acknowledge BLANK -MP batch EXCEEDED performance targets by 3-6%
