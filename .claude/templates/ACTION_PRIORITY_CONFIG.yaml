# Scoring rules for action prioritization engine
# Adjust these values to tune priority rankings without code changes

# Last Updated: 2025-11-14
# Version: 1.0

# ==============================================================================
# EMAIL SCORING RULES
# ==============================================================================
# Higher scores = higher urgency
# Adjust if emails always/never top priority

email_scores:
  critical_last_hour: 50      # Emails from last 60 minutes (highest urgency)
  yesterday: 20               # Emails from yesterday (medium urgency)
  last_week: 10               # Emails from last 7 days (lower urgency)

# ==============================================================================
# DEAL SCORING RULES
# ==============================================================================
# Higher scores = more important
# Adjust based on business priorities

deal_scores:
  high_priority: 40           # HubSpot HIGH priority flag
  overdue_task: 30            # Has overdue task in HubSpot
  stuck_21_days: -50          # No movement in 21+ days (DEAD DEAL - negative points)
  stuck_14_days: -25          # No movement in 14-20 days (STALE - negative points)
  stuck_7_days: 15            # No movement in 7-13 days (needs follow-up)
  implementation_stage: 15    # In implementation stage (active work)
  rate_creation_stage: 15     # In rate creation stage (critical path)
  proposal_sent_stage: 10     # Proposal sent, awaiting response

# ==============================================================================
# STAGE WEIGHTS
# ==============================================================================
# Higher weight = more attention needed
# CRITICAL: Stage is MOST important factor (matches prioritization_agent.py)
# Revenue-generating stages get highest weights

stage_weights:
  "08d9c411-5e1b-487b-8732-9c2bcbbd0307": 50     # [06-IMPLEMENTATION] (HIGHEST: New customer about to ship)
  "4e549d01-674b-4b31-8a90-91ec03122715": 42     # [05-SETUP-DOCS-SENT] (Setup phase, nearly closed)
  "d607df25-2c6d-4a5d-9835-6ed1e4f4020a": 35     # [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] (Proposal out, awaiting decision)
  "e1c4321e-afb6-4b29-97d4-2b2425488535": 27     # [03-RATE-CREATION] (Creating rates, active sales work)
  "d2a08d6f-cc04-4423-9215-594fe682e538": 17     # [02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE] (Discovery done, needs follow-up)
  "1090865183": 10                                # [01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED] (LOWEST: Early stage/leads)
  "3fd46d94-78b4-452b-8704-62a338a210fb": 5      # [07-STARTED-SHIPPING] (Customer, not sales priority)

# ==============================================================================
# ACTION DISPLAY SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================

# Number of top actions to display in sync reports
# Default: 3 (can increase to 5 for more options)
top_action_count: 3

# Maximum score for score normalization
# Actions are scored 0-100, this caps the display range
max_display_score: 100

# ==============================================================================
# CONTINUITY VALIDATION SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================

continuity_validation:
  # Strict mode: Fail sync if validation fails
  # Warn-only mode: Print warning but continue sync
  strict_mode: false
  warn_only: true

  # Required sections for each sync type
  # These sections must exist in _DAILY_LOG.md for validation to pass
  required_sections:
    9am:
      - "Yesterday's Completions"
      - "Yesterday's Learnings"
    noon:
      - "TODAY'S TOP 3 PRIORITIES"
      - "Morning Progress"
    3pm:
      - "NOON CHECK-IN"
      - "Afternoon Progress"
    eod:
      - "3PM CHECK-IN"
      - "End of Day Wrap"

# ==============================================================================
# TIME THRESHOLDS
# ==============================================================================

time_thresholds:
  # Days without movement to consider "stuck"
  stuck_warning_days: 14
  stuck_critical_days: 21

  # Email age categories (in hours)
  critical_email_age: 1     # Last hour
  recent_email_age: 24      # Yesterday
  older_email_age: 168      # Last week (7 days)

# ==============================================================================
# TUNING NOTES
# ==============================================================================
#
# If emails always outrank deals:
#   - Reduce email_scores values
#   - Increase deal_scores values
#
# If stuck deals not showing up:
#   - Increase stuck_14_days and stuck_21_days scores
#   - Decrease time_thresholds.stuck_warning_days
#
# If wrong stages prioritized:
#   - Adjust stage_weights for bottleneck stages
#   - Increase weights for stages that need attention
#
# If validation too strict:
#   - Set strict_mode: false
#   - Set warn_only: true
#   - Remove required_sections if too many false positives
#
