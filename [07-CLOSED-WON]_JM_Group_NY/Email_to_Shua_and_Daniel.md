Shua and Daniel,

Attached is the comprehensive FirstMile Xparcel performance report for JM Group NY covering the period of August 7 through September 29, 2025 (2,817 total shipments).

## Executive Summary

**Overall Performance: 99.9% SLA Compliance - Exceeds Standard**

JM Group NY is performing exceptionally well across all three Xparcel service levels with only 1 delivered package out of 1,141 missing its SLA window.

## SLA Performance by Service Level (Delivered Packages)

| Service Level | SLA Window | Delivered | Within SLA | Compliance | Status |
|--------------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Xparcel Priority** | 3 days | 26 | 26 | **100.0%** | Perfect Compliance |
| **Xparcel Expedited** | 5 days | 62 | 62 | **100.0%** | Perfect Compliance |
| **Xparcel Ground** | 8 days | 1,053 | 1,052 | **99.9%** | Exceeds Standard |

### Key Performance Insights:
- **Priority**: All 26 packages delivered same day (Day 0)
- **Expedited**: Average 2.0 days, 100% delivered by Day 4 (within 5-day window)
- **Ground**: Average 3.3 days, **95.3% delivered by Day 6** (well within 8-day window)

Only 1 Ground package exceeded the 8-day SLA (delivered on Day 10).

## In-Transit Analysis - Action Required

While delivered performance is excellent, we have identified **634 in-transit shipments (37.8%) currently outside their SLA windows** that require immediate attention:

**In-Transit Status:**
- Total In-Transit: 1,676 shipments
- Within SLA Window: 1,042 (62.2%)
- **Outside SLA Window (Late): 634 (37.8%)**

**43 Total SLA Misses:**
- 1 delivered outside SLA
- 42 in-transit outside SLA window (these are already late even though not yet delivered)

## Actionable Intelligence (Tab 8 - SLA Misses)

The report includes a detailed **SLA Misses tab** with:

1. **Summary by Service Level** - breakdown of misses by Priority/Expedited/Ground
2. **Top 20 ZIPs by Misses** - identifies problematic destination clusters
3. **Suggested Actions** for each miss:
   - "Evaluate ZIP-limit: Ground â†’ Expedited for this ZIP cluster"
   - "Investigate linehaul and induction cadence for this lane"
   - "Consider Expedited for Zones 7-8 on this lane"

## Network Distribution

- **Select Network**: 45% of volume
- **National Network**: 55% of volume
- SLA performance is consistent across both networks

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Review the 634 in-transit packages currently outside SLA windows (detailed in Tab 6: In-Transit Detail)
2. **Short-term**: Address the Top 20 ZIPs identified in the SLA Misses tab to prevent future issues
3. **Ongoing**: Consider service level adjustments for high-zone destinations (7-8) where Ground may struggle to meet the 8-day window

## Report Structure (9 Tabs)

1. Executive Summary - High-level KPIs
2. SLA Compliance - Detailed metrics by service level
3. Transit Performance - Day-by-day delivery distribution

Please review the attached report, particularly **Tab 8 (SLA Misses)** and **Tab 6 (In-Transit Detail)**, and let me know if you need any additional analysis or clarification.

The delivered performance is outstanding at 99.9%, but we need to address the in-transit outliers to maintain this level of service.

Best regards,
Brett Walker
