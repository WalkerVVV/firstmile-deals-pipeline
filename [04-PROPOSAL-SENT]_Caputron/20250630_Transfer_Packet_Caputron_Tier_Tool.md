# CHAT TRANSFER PACKET - CAPUTRON TIER TOOL
*June 30, 2025 - Sunday Evening*

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT
Brett (Neo) is filling out his tier tool for Caputron rate creation. We just completed the weekly volume matrix (5-day multiplication) with correct service mapping:
- USPS GA → Xparcel Expedited 
- Added 5% of Expedited volume to Ground
- Created 3-column format: Priority | Expedited | Ground
