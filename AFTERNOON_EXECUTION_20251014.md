**Email Body**:

```
Subject: IronLink Skupreme - FirstMile Proposal: 17 Days Until Halloween Peak

Hi [Contact Name],

Following up on the FirstMile savings analysis I sent over showing **$233,314 annual savings** for IronLink Skupreme.

We're now 17 days from Halloween (October 31) - the start of peak season chaos. Carrier surcharges go live, capacity tightens, and shipping costs spike.

**What We Showed You**:
- $233,314 annual savings vs your current setup
- Multi-carrier flexibility (no single-carrier bottlenecks)
- 3 service levels: Economy, Expedited, Priority
- Peak season protection: Our surcharges are lower than major carriers

**The Clock is Ticking**:
If you want FirstMile rates protecting you this peak season, we need to move now. Implementation takes 48-72 hours, so October 31 is our hard deadline.

**Quick 15-Minute Call This Week?**

I can walk you through:
1. How the $233K savings breaks down by service level
2. Peak season surcharge comparison (FirstMile vs UPS/FedEx/USPS)
3. 48-hour implementation timeline
4. Q&A on anything unclear in the analysis

Reply with your availability, or let me know if you have questions about the proposal.

Peak season waits for no one - let's get you protected before Halloween.

Best regards,
Brett Walker
FirstMile | Account Executive
(850) 291-8117
brett.walker@firstmile.com

P.S. - After Halloween, you'll be stuck with carrier surcharges through mid-January. Lock in FirstMile rates now and save through Q4.

## üìß TASK 5: SEND FFE SOLUTIONS DATA REQUEST (15 MIN)

**To**: [FFE Solutions contact email from HubSpot]
**Subject**: FFE Solutions - Shipment Data Request for FirstMile Rate Analysis

**Email Body**:

```
Subject: FFE Solutions - Shipment Data Request for FirstMile Rate Analysis

Hi [Contact Name],

I'm working on creating a FirstMile rate card for FFE Solutions, but I need some shipment data to build an accurate savings analysis.

**What I Need**:
A CSV export of your last **2-4 weeks of shipments** including:
- Ship date
- Destination ZIP code
- Package weight (actual weight)
- Package dimensions (L √ó W √ó H)
- Service level used (Ground, Express, Priority, etc.)
- Current carrier (UPS, FedEx, USPS, etc.)
- Current cost per shipment (if available)

**Why This Matters**:
With this data, I can show you:
1. Exact package-by-package cost comparison (current vs FirstMile rates)
2. Annual savings projection based on your real volume
3. Service level breakdown (which packages benefit most)
4. Zone analysis (where you're spending the most)

**Data Export Instructions**:
Most shipping platforms (ShipStation, Shippo, etc.) have a CSV export function. If you need help exporting, let me know your platform and I can walk you through it.

**Timeline**:
Once I receive the data, I can deliver a full savings analysis within 3-5 business days.

Can you send over the shipment data this week? Happy to schedule a quick call if you have questions about what's needed.

Best regards,
Brett Walker
FirstMile | Account Executive
(850) 291-8117
brett.walker@firstmile.com

P.S. - If your platform doesn't allow CSV export, a screenshot of your shipping summary page works too. I just need volume, weight, and destination data.

### Talking Points for Landon Call

**Opening**:
"Hi Landon, thanks for taking the time. I wanted to walk you through the corrected FirstMile analysis showing $83,547 in annual savings for Stackd Logistics. I know I sent the spreadsheet over, but wanted to make sure everything made sense and answer any questions you have."

**Volume Correction Explanation**:
"Quick note on the volume correction: The original analysis treated 8,418 packages as monthly volume, but I realized that was actually 2 weeks of data. So we've corrected it to 16,836 packages per month, which is more accurate for your actual monthly volume. That doubled the savings from $41K to $83K annually, but the percentage (9.5%) stayed the same."

**Key Value Props**:
1. **$83,547 Annual Savings (9.5%)**:
   - "You're currently spending about $880K annually on shipping. FirstMile brings that down to $796K - saving you $83,547 per year."

2. **Select Network = Biggest Opportunity (15.7% savings)**:
   - "6,384 of your packages per month go to major metros (LA, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, etc.). That's where FirstMile's Select Network saves you 15.7% - about $72K per year."

3. **National Network = Full Coverage (2.7% savings)**:
   - "The remaining 10,452 packages per month use our National Network for 100% ZIP coverage. Smaller savings (2.7%), but still $11K annually plus the flexibility of multi-carrier routing."

4. **Multi-Carrier Flexibility**:
   - "One big advantage: FirstMile dynamically routes between carriers based on cost and service level. You're not locked into one carrier's capacity constraints or service disruptions."

**Questions to Ask Landon**:
1. "Does the 16,836 monthly volume sound accurate for Stackd Logistics?"
2. "Any questions about how we split between Select and National networks?"
3. "What's your typical peak season volume? (So we can project Q4 savings)"
4. "Are there any specific service level requirements we should factor in? (2-day, 3-day, etc.)"
5. "What's your process for evaluating new shipping providers? (Decision timeline, stakeholders involved)"

**Objection Handling**:

**Objection**: "9.5% savings isn't enough to switch."
**Response**: "$83K per year is significant, but you're right to look at the full picture. Beyond cost, FirstMile offers multi-carrier flexibility, so you're not dependent on one carrier's capacity. Plus, our Audit Queue catches mis-rated labels before billing - that alone can save 1-2% on top of the 9.5%."

**Objection**: "We're locked into a contract with our current carrier."
**Response**: "No problem. When does your contract end? We can start planning now and be ready to implement day one when you're out of contract. Implementation takes 48 hours, so you won't lose any time."

**Objection**: "We need to see references/case studies."
**Response**: "Absolutely. I can share case studies of similar logistics companies we've helped. Would you like to speak to a current customer directly, or are written case studies enough?"

**Objection**: "This seems too good to be true."
**Response**: "I get that. The savings come from FirstMile's network optimization - we dynamically route to the most cost-effective induction point each night. We're not a broker reselling carrier rates; we're a carrier ourselves with our own network. That's how we beat traditional carrier pricing by 10-15% in major metros."

**Next Steps**:
1. "If everything looks good, next step is sending setup docs and getting you integrated. Implementation takes 48 hours - we could have you shipping via FirstMile by end of this week if you're ready."
2. "Any concerns or additional information you need before moving forward?"
3. "What's your timeline for making a decision on this?"

**Goal**: Verbal commitment to move forward, OR clear next steps defined (stakeholder meeting, reference check, etc.)
