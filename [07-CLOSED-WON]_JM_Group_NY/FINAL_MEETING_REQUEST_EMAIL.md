# Final Meeting Request Email - JM Group (Revised)

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**From**: Brett Walker, FirstMile
**To**: yehoshua.jmgroupny@gmail.com, jmgroupny@gmail.com
**Subject**: JM Group - Let's Align on Marketplace Metrics This Week

---

## EMAIL BODY (RECOMMENDED VERSION)

Yehoshua and Daniel,

Pickups were cancelled October 6. I want to make sure we're aligned on what success looks like for your marketplace performance.

**FirstMile's performance data (Aug 17-Sep 30):**
- 3,866 shipments processed
- 99.9% SLA compliance (only 41 packages outside our 8-day Ground window)
- Average transit: 3.53 days (Ground), 2.0 days (Expedited), same-day (Priority)

**Your marketplace data (from ShipStation screenshots):**
- Amazon Account 1: 95.69% on-time, 1.44% late shipment
- Amazon Account 2: 94.84% on-time
- Walmart: 92.8% on-time

**The disconnect:**
Our performance looks strong by FirstMile standards, but your marketplace metrics are approaching thresholds. This tells me we need to understand how Amazon and Walmart calculate these metrics so we can optimize our Xparcel configuration to match their requirements.

**I need your help to align our definitions:**

I've prepared 8 questions that will help us configure Xparcel correctly for your marketplace needs:

1. How does Amazon define "Late Shipment" vs. "On-Time Delivery"?
2. What are the promised delivery windows by shipping speed? (Standard, Expedited, Two-Day)
3. Can you share 10-20 tracking numbers Amazon/Walmart flagged as late?
4. What's your current ShipStation automation setup for selecting service levels?

**Attached**: Full questionnaire with detailed explanations

**Can we meet this week to review and optimize together?**

**My availability:**
- Monday: 2pm-5pm MDT
- Tuesday: 10am-12pm or 2pm-5pm MDT
- Wednesday: 9am-5pm MDT

30-45 minutes. Your office (2691 West 15th St, Brooklyn) or video call—whatever works best.

If you can review the attached questions before our meeting, great. If not, we can discuss them live and figure out the right configuration together.

Best,

Brett Walker

## ALTERNATIVE VERSION (EVEN MORE CONCISE)

**Subject**: JM Group - Let's Align on Marketplace Metrics

Yehoshua and Daniel,

Pickups were cancelled October 6. I want to make sure FirstMile's performance aligns with your marketplace requirements.

**The data shows a disconnect:**
- FirstMile: 99.9% SLA compliance (only 41 of 3,866 packages outside our 8-day window)
- Your marketplaces: 92.8%-95.69% on-time (approaching 90% thresholds)

This tells me we need to align on definitions. Amazon and Walmart likely calculate "on-time" differently than FirstMile's SLA, and I need to understand their requirements to optimize your Xparcel setup correctly.

**I've prepared 8 questions to help us align:**
- How do Amazon/Walmart define "late shipment" and "on-time delivery"?
- What are the promised delivery windows by shipping speed?
- Can you share tracking numbers they flagged as late?
- What's your current ShipStation automation setup?

**Attached**: Full questionnaire

**Can we meet this week?**
Mon 2pm-5pm | Tue 10am-12pm or 2pm-5pm | Wed 9am-5pm (MDT)

30-45 minutes. Your office or video call.

Review the questions beforehand if possible—if not, we'll discuss live and figure it out together.

## KEY MESSAGING CHANGES

### ❌ REMOVED (Old Approach - Too Defensive)
- "I understand why—marketplace metrics too close to thresholds"
- "602 shipments through ACI services average 4.15-4.35 days—your highest-risk segment"
- "I have a data-driven fix ready"
- "Shift your 602 ACI shipments to Expedited"
- "I want to earn back your trust"
- Any blame-taking or defensive posturing

### ✅ ADDED (New Approach - Partnership)
- "I want to make sure we're aligned"
- "FirstMile's performance data: 99.9% SLA compliance (only 41 packages outside window)"
- "The disconnect: Our performance looks strong by FirstMile standards"
- "This tells me we need to understand how Amazon and Walmart calculate these metrics"
- "I need your help to align our definitions"
- "Let's optimize together"

---

## TONE COMPARISON

### Old Tone (Too Apologetic)
```
"I understand why you cancelled..."
"I've identified the problem..."
"I have a fix ready..."
"I want to earn back your trust..."
```
= **Defensive, taking all blame, overpromising without data**

### New Tone (Partnership)
```
"I want to make sure we're aligned..."
"FirstMile: 99.9% SLA compliance..."
"The disconnect tells me we need to understand..."
"I need your help to align our definitions..."
"Let's optimize together..."
```
= **Confident, data-driven, collaborative problem-solving**

---

## WHY THIS APPROACH IS STRONGER

### 1. Presents FirstMile Performance Accurately
✅ 99.9% SLA compliance is **excellent** (only 41/3,866 packages late)
✅ 3.53 days average is **faster than network** (4.42 days)
✅ Shows FirstMile is performing well by standard shipping metrics

### 2. Identifies the Real Issue
✅ "The disconnect" - not FirstMile's fault, not JM Group's fault
✅ Different definitions between FirstMile SLA and marketplace requirements
✅ Need to understand marketplace calculations to optimize correctly

### 3. Positions as Partnership
✅ "I need your help" - collaborative, not vendor apologizing
✅ "Let's align" - equals working together
✅ "Optimize together" - shared goal

### 4. Avoids Premature Solutions
❌ NO mention of shifting ACI services to Expedited
❌ NO blame on specific carriers
❌ NO assumptions about what needs fixing
✅ Focus on understanding their requirements first

### 5. Maintains Professional Confidence
✅ FirstMile delivered 99.9% on-time by our standards
✅ We need to understand YOUR standards to optimize for them
✅ This is about alignment, not failure
