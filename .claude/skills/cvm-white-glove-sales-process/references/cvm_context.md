# CVM White Glove Philosophy - Context & Quotes

This file provides context on Christopher Von Melville's (CVM) white glove sales philosophy, including key quotes from the original sales team meeting that informed this methodology.

## CVM's Core Philosophy

### On Network Reality vs. Sales Promises

> "I will not sit or stand in front of you and tell you the network is going to perform if I don't think it is. In fact I'll be the one that creates the emails that I've received from my Keith and Kevin. They're like, 'You should probably watch what you put on email internal groups because I blow up like I will send nuclear bombs their way so that they realize and to a large group so that there is no cheerleading."

**Principle**: Never overpromise. Maintain credibility by being honest about current state vs. future state.

---

### On Sales Team Morale & Empathy

> "I realize that you guys are from a morale and a motivational standpoint right now and over the last 60 days it has been shit. I don't know how else to say that and I realized that the rug's been pulled up from underneath you from a comp standpoint in some instances and you've lost a tremendous amount."

**CVM's Personal Experience**:
> "I went let's put it this way, I went from really good commissions to literally goose egging it for like 13 or 14 straight months... I just want you gentlemen to know that I know how it feels."

**Principle**: Leadership credibility comes from shared struggle, not from theory.

---

### On Volume Reality Check (Discovery)

> "What commitments do you have to other clients? What volume do you not control right? What volume can't flow through our network because our network doesn't support that service right? And so you can get to a specific volume or at least within a 10% variance of a specific volume that says okay, so really rather than a million packages a year we're talking about 300,000."

**Principle**: Convert aspirational numbers to REAL commitments through systematic questioning.

---

### On Test Period Negotiation

> "Most customers say want to test for two weeks. So you say okay well we need a meaningful test. So we'd like to get 30% 50% whatever you feel is appropriate. You guys are the professionals. Whatever you feel is appropriate. That's what we want for the test for two weeks as long as the transit times they are the billing works. You don't have any issues then after that two weeks we would like to ramp to whatever the volume was that was agreed do we have agreement so that's more white blooded right then."

**Principle**: Lock in test-to-ramp agreement BEFORE implementation starts.

---

### On White Glove Implementation

> "I have literally shoulder to shoulder with that person making sure that I am on every single implementation call so that if there is any issue or any comment that is made which I've had to do a lot lately with these enterprise clients. If there's any comments that are made that are contradict what was agreed to in the sales process you immediately jump in."

**Principle**: Sales doesn't hand off—sales stays shoulder-to-shoulder through implementation.

---

### On The "Slippery Slope" (Post-Test Period)

> "This is where it gets crucial because this is where the company needs to realize the revenue for us to hit our our goals over the next few years. It's just to 50 packages a day um and at the ramp and then we're going to build into that so I think it's important that the um that you're shoulder to shoulder with implementation and that's that last bullet point and that you don't leave the sales process so that it kind of can potentially slide into the ditch right it's very slippery right there and it's a very easy it's a very easy time for a um for a making sure client to take the easy road off the exit."

**Principle**: Weeks 2-4 post-test are where revenue dies if not actively managed.

---

### On Contradiction Management

Example scenarios from CVM:

**Scenario 1 - Volume Bait & Switch**:
> "If on the call when Melissa says you know we're good to go the training's done can we set up first pickup they're like yeah we'll give you like 15 packages a day and you're like oh whoa timeout we've been talking about like 200 dropped off your facility at this time here's the BOL."

**Scenario 2 - Service Misalignment**:
Customer says: "Brett said we're going to get this or we're going to do this or this is our service"

CVM's instruction:
> "That's where you jumped in and you literally are like wait a minute here hold on I just want to make sure we're level set."

**Principle**: Jump in immediately when contradictions occur—don't let them fester.

---

### On Proactive Implementation Indicators

> "What I really like about some of these pickups that the team has scheduled they literally are like, and I don't know because it's hit and miss but sometimes I get these emails they're like hey we picked up from gift Express at this time of year dropped off at your facility at this time here's the BOL and I'm like well this is cool like that's proactive so at least I know the pickup was me right."

**Principle**: Proactive operational confirmations = good sign. Silence = red flag.

---

## The 32 Questions Framework

While CVM referenced "32 questions" in the transcript, the core questions focus on:

1. **Carrier Commitments**: "What commitments do you have to other carriers?"
2. **Control**: "What volume do you NOT control?"
3. **Service Limitations**: "What volume CAN'T flow through our network?"
4. **Realistic Projections**: "Of your total volume, what can we realistically win?"

These questions systematically deconstruct customer's stated volume into realistic, achievable commitments.

---

## Implementation Team Dynamics

CVM mentions specific implementation team members:
- **Tiaki**: Implementation team member
- **Diana**: Implementation team member
- **Melissa Clayton**: Implementation lead who conducts training

**Key Instruction**: Sales must be on ALL emails and calls with these team members during implementation.

---

## Success Criteria

CVM's mention of what "good" looks like:

**Network Performance Targets**:
- Current state: IRT adding 3-4 unnecessary days
- 30-day target: Service improvements in place
- 45-day target: "Hell yes" network performance

**Volume Ramp Expectations**:
- Test period: 30-50% of committed volume
- Post-test (assuming success): 100% of committed volume
- Timeline: Immediate ramp after successful test completion

## When to Apply White Glove

### APPLY White Glove When:
- Enterprise accounts (implied by CVM's focus)
- Significant volume commitments (200+ packages/day discussed in examples)
- Complex implementations with multiple stakeholders
- Accounts critical to revenue goals

### DO NOT Apply White Glove When:
- Small accounts where economics don't justify intensive involvement
- Customers with proven track record of meeting commitments
- Internal/partner test accounts

## CVM's Sales Team Commitment

> "I have no problem flying all over the country five days a week for the next 32 weeks straight if it means that I can get deals closed with you guys and help you guys get deals through the pipeline so that you can rebuild back to an adequate or at least a healthy amount of commission."

**Leadership Philosophy**: Active involvement, not theoretical guidance. CVM commits to being in the field, closing deals alongside the team.

---

## 2026 Commission Structure Context

While not directly part of white glove methodology, CVM's compensation changes provide context:

- Year 1 commission: 18% (up from 14%)
- No goal-based reductions (you get 18% regardless of quota)
- Year 1 = 13 months (first month is ramp)
- Anything launching Jan 1, 2026+ gets new 18% rate

This aggressive compensation structure reflects FirstMile's need to rapidly scale revenue and rebuild sales team morale after service challenges.

---

## Key Terminology

- **White Glove**: Active sales involvement through implementation, not just closing
- **Level Set**: Real-time correction of contradictions or misalignments
- **Shoulder to Shoulder**: Sales physically (or virtually) present with implementation team
- **Hold Feet to Fire**: Enforce commitments made during sales process
- **Slide into the Ditch**: When deals fail during implementation due to lack of oversight
- **Easy Road Off the Exit**: When customers abandon commitments due to convenience

---

## Real-World Examples from CVM

**Gift Express (New York)**:
- Deal done through ex-parcel
- Proactive pickup confirmations
- Example of good implementation execution

**Enterprise Clients (Unnamed)**:
- CVM has been heavily involved in recent enterprise implementations
- Experiencing contradictions that require real-time correction
- White glove approach being actively practiced

---

## Cultural Context: FirstMile Network Challenges

CVM's candid assessment of network reality:

**Current State (at time of meeting)**:
- IRT (Expedited Non-Workshare) adding 3-4 days of unnecessary transit
- Last 60 days have been "shit" for service performance
- Sales team struggling to sell due to service confidence issues

**Future State (30-45 days)**:
- Network will be fixed and performing
- Sales team can sell with confidence
- White glove approach ensures successful implementation

This context explains why the white glove methodology emphasizes:
1. Not overpromising service
2. Active oversight during implementation
3. Data-driven performance tracking
4. Rapid response to issues

---

## Application Notes

When using this white glove methodology, remember:

1. **Context Matters**: CVM developed this in response to FirstMile's specific challenges (network issues, commission changes, team morale)
2. **Leadership Credibility**: CVM's credibility comes from shared struggle and transparency, not corporate cheerleading
3. **Revenue Focus**: This methodology exists to ensure closed deals convert to actual shipped volume (revenue realization)
4. **Relationship-Driven**: White glove works because it builds trust through consistency and follow-through
