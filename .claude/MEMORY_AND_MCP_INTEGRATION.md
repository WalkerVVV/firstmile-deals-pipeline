# Memory & MCP Integration Guide
**Continuous Learning + HubSpot Integration for Nebuchadnezzar v2.0**

---

## Overview

This guide covers two critical systems:
1. **Claude Memory System** - Persistent learning across sessions
2. **HubSpot MCP Integration** - Direct HubSpot API access via MCP protocol

---

## Part 1: Claude Memory System

### What is Claude Memory?

Claude's memory system allows persistent storage of learnings, patterns, and context across sessions. Unlike temporary context, memories are:
- **Persistent**: Survive session restarts
- **Retrievable**: Automatically recalled when relevant
- **Updatable**: Can be refined based on new learnings

### Memory Categories for Nebuchadnezzar

#### 1. Pipeline Patterns & Best Practices
```
Memory Name: "Pipeline Best Practices - {Topic}"

Examples:
- "Pipeline Best Practices - Rate Creation"
- "Pipeline Best Practices - Discovery Calls"
- "Pipeline Best Practices - Follow-up Timing"
```

#### 2. Customer Relationship Insights
```
Memory Name: "Customer Pattern - {Pattern Type}"

Examples:
- "Customer Pattern - Decision Making Process"
- "Customer Pattern - Data Request Timing"
- "Customer Pattern - Pricing Sensitivity"
```

#### 3. Deal Execution Learnings
```
Memory Name: "Deal Learning - {Company} - {Topic}"

Examples:
- "Deal Learning - Stackd - Rate Presentation"
- "Deal Learning - DYLN - Multi-location Discovery"
- "Deal Learning - Driftaway - Recovery Strategy"
```

#### 4. System Optimizations
```
Memory Name: "System Optimization - {Area}"

Examples:
- "System Optimization - Email Templates"
- "System Optimization - Internal Dependencies"
- "System Optimization - SLA Management"
```

### How to Use Memory in Daily Syncs

#### EOD Sync Memory Capture

**After completing EOD sync, save learnings to memory:**

```markdown
## EOD Sync - {Date} - Memory Capture

### What Worked ✅ → Save to Memory
Pattern: Customer Relationship Documentation
Memory: "Pipeline Best Practices - Documentation"
Learning: "Creating Customer_Relationship_Documentation.md for all [01-QUALIFIED]+ deals saves 30min per deal and prevents information loss. Make this mandatory for all qualified opportunities."

### What Failed ❌ → Save to Memory
Pattern: Brock Data Dependency
Memory: "System Optimization - Internal Dependencies"
Learning: "Always pre-check internal dependencies (Brock data, JIRA status, pricing approvals) BEFORE communicating delivery timelines to customers. This prevents credibility gaps."

### Emerging Pattern → Save to Memory
Pattern: Multi-location Discovery
Memory: "Customer Pattern - Multi-location Opportunities"
Learning: "Asking 'Any other locations or brands?' during discovery can 3X deal value. DYLN went from $1.2M to $3.6M with this question. Add to standard discovery script."
```

**Command to save memory:**
```
Please save this to memory under the name "[Memory Name]": [Learning content]
```

#### 9AM Sync Memory Retrieval

**Start each day by asking:**
```
"Retrieve memories related to:
- Pipeline best practices
- [Specific deal name] learnings
- [Specific challenge] patterns"
```

**Example:**
```
User: "I'm working on Stackd Logistics proposal presentation today. What do we know?"

Claude retrieves:
- Memory: "Deal Learning - Stackd - Rate Presentation"
- Memory: "Pipeline Best Practices - Proposal Delivery"
- Memory: "Customer Pattern - Decision Making Process"
```

### Memory Update Workflow

**Weekly Memory Refinement (Friday EOD)**:

1. **Review Current Memories**
   ```
   "Show me all memories related to pipeline optimization"
   ```

2. **Update Based on New Data**
   ```
   "Update memory 'Pipeline Best Practices - Follow-up Timing' with:
   New learning: 7-day follow-up on proposals shows 40% higher response rate than 14-day"
   ```

3. **Archive Outdated Patterns**
   ```
   "Mark memory 'Old Process - Rate Creation' as superseded by SOP v3.2"
   ```

### Memory Categories & Naming Convention

```yaml
Naming Pattern: "{Category} - {Specific Topic} - {Optional Subcategory}"

Categories:
  - "Pipeline Best Practices"
  - "Customer Pattern"
  - "Deal Learning"
  - "System Optimization"
  - "SOP Evolution"
  - "Competitive Intelligence"
  - "Internal Process"

Examples:
  ✅ "Pipeline Best Practices - Discovery - Multi-location Questions"
  ✅ "Customer Pattern - Pricing - Discount Thresholds"
  ✅ "Deal Learning - DYLN - Multi-site Opportunity Discovery"
  ✅ "System Optimization - Email - Critical Ask Separation"
  ✅ "SOP Evolution - v3.1 - Customer Relationship Docs"
```

### Integration with Daily Sync Files

**EOD Sync Template Enhancement:**

```markdown
## EOD Sync - {Date}

### What Worked ✅
1. **{Pattern Name}**
   - What: {Description}
   - Impact: {Measurable result}
   - **MEMORY**: Save as "{Memory Name}"
   - **KEEP**: {Action to make permanent}

### What Failed ❌
1. **{Problem}**
   - What happened: {Description}
   - Risk: {Business impact}
   - **MEMORY**: Save as "{Memory Name}"
   - **FIX**: {Corrective action}

[At end of sync]
## Memory Capture Commands

```
Please save these learnings to memory:
1. Name: "Pipeline Best Practices - {Topic}"
   Content: "{Learning from What Worked}"

2. Name: "System Optimization - {Area}"
   Content: "{Learning from What Failed}"
```
```

### Using HubSpot MCP in Daily Syncs

#### 9AM Sync with HubSpot MCP

**Instead of manual Python scripts:**
```markdown
## 9AM Sync - HubSpot MCP Integration

# Step 1: Get all active deals
Use: hubspot-search-deals
Filter: owner_id=699257003, pipeline=8bd9336b-4767-4e67-9fe2-35dfcad7c8be

# Step 2: Get deals by priority stages
Use: hubspot-search-deals
Filter: dealstage IN [1090865183, d607df25-2c6d-4a5d-9835-6ed1e4f4020a]

# Step 3: Create follow-up tasks
For each priority deal:
  Use: hubspot-create-task
  Properties: title, due_date, priority, deal_id
```

#### EOD Sync with HubSpot MCP

**Log activities directly:**
```markdown
# After customer touchpoint
Use: hubspot-create-note
Deal ID: {deal_id}
Note: "Call with Jordan - Discussed pricing, needs CFO approval. Follow-up Oct 14."

# Create next-day task
Use: hubspot-create-task
Deal ID: {deal_id}
Title: "Follow up post-CFO approval"
Due: 2025-10-14
Priority: HIGH
```

### Verification Commands

**Check MCP status:**
```bash
# List all MCP servers
claude mcp list

# Check HubSpot connection
claude mcp test hubspot

# View available tools
claude mcp describe hubspot
```

## Part 3: Integrated Memory + MCP Workflow

### Daily Sync with Memory & MCP

#### 9AM Sync - Complete Flow

**1. Retrieve Relevant Memories**
```
Claude, retrieve memories related to:
- Pipeline best practices for rate creation
- Stackd Logistics deal learnings
- Follow-up timing patterns
```

**2. Query HubSpot via MCP**
```
Use hubspot-search-deals to get:
- All deals in [03-RATE-CREATION] stage
- All deals in [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] stage
- Deals not modified in >14 days
```

**3. Generate Priority Actions**
```
Based on:
- Retrieved memories (what's worked before)
- Current HubSpot deal status
- SLA thresholds

Output: Priority action list with context from memory
```

#### EOD Sync - Complete Flow

**1. Log Activities to HubSpot**
```
For each customer touchpoint:
  Use: hubspot-create-note
  Deal ID: {id}
  Content: {summary}
```

**2. Create Tomorrow's Tasks**
```
Use: hubspot-create-task
Based on: Memory of optimal follow-up timing
```

**3. Capture Learnings to Memory**
```
Save to memory:
- What worked (with HubSpot deal examples)
- What failed (with corrective actions)
- Emerging patterns (for future deals)
```

**4. Update _DAILY_LOG_FEEDBACK.md**
```
Include:
- HubSpot activity summary
- Memory captures performed
- Cross-reference between memory and HubSpot
```

## Troubleshooting

### HubSpot MCP Issues

**Issue**: MCP server not connecting
```bash
# Check server status
claude mcp list

# Restart server
claude mcp restart hubspot

# Check logs
claude mcp logs hubspot
```

**Issue**: Authentication errors
```
# Verify API key is valid
# Check HubSpot portal access
# Regenerate token if needed
```

### Memory Issues

**Issue**: Memories not persisting
```
# Verify memory was saved
"List all memories created today"

# Re-save if needed
"Save to memory as '{Name}': {Content}"
```

**Issue**: Memory retrieval not working
```
# Check memory name
"Show memory named '{exact name}'"

# Try broader search
"Retrieve all memories related to: {topic}"
```
