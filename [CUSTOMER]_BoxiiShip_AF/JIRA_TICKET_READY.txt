Hi Sales! I need you to please create new Xparcel Domestic rates for BoxiiShip American Fork. They are meeting with Make Wellness tomorrow, October 10th, at 11am. Make Wellness is feeling the pinch of $45K-$50K above FirstMile costs per week after switching to UPS back in July. Here's the situation:

LOST CUSTOMER - WIN-BACK OPPORTUNITY:
• Lost Make Wellness in July 2025 (performance issues in April - now resolved)
• Daily volume: 5,000 packages (25,000/week)
• Annual revenue: $7.1M
• Customer overpaying UPS $45K-$50K/week since July ($1.17M-$1.3M total)
• Window is open - they're feeling cost pain NOW

WHAT'S NEEDED:
• Xparcel Priority National rates (68% of volume)
• Xparcel Priority Select rates (68% of volume)
• Xparcel Expedited National rates (32% of volume)
• Xparcel Expedited Select rates (32% of volume)

• Weekly: 25,000 packages (5 shipping days/week)
• Annual revenue: $7.1M

GOAL:

• Demonstrate $45K-$50K/week savings vs current UPS costs
• Give Nate competitive rates for tomorrow's 11am meeting
• Win back $7.1M annual revenue

PERFORMANCE CONTEXT:
• April 24-28, 2025: Performance collapse (ACI-WS routing issue)
• May 2025: Issue resolved, 5+ months stable performance since
• Customer left before seeing improvements
• Service must be spot-on for win-back (trust is fragile)
• No ACI-WS routing for TX, AZ

ADDITIONAL INFO:
• 700+ service credits may be offered from April issues
• Previous rate file attached for reference
• Meeting: October 10th, 2025 at 11am
• URGENT - need rates ASAP

Thank you for urgent attention to this $7.1M win-back opportunity.
