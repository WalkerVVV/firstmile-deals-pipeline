## Key Talking Points (If Customer Asks Questions)

### "Why are there peak surcharges?"
"Peak season (October-January) brings 30-40% more volume across the entire shipping industry. All carriers add peak surcharges to manage capacity and prioritize shipments. FirstMile's surcharges are positioned at ~50% of what UPS, FedEx, and other major carriers charge during peak."

### "How much will this cost me?"
"For Select Network customers, it's a flat $0.32 per package - very competitive. For National Network, it ranges from $0.62-$1.57 depending on weight and zone. Even with these surcharges, you're still saving [X%] compared to major carriers' peak pricing."

### "Why wasn't I notified sooner?"
"The surcharges went into effect October 5, which was communicated centrally to all customers. We're following up individually with customers in our integration pipeline and recent launches to make sure everyone is aware. I apologize if the timing was tight - that's on us."

### "Can I avoid the surcharge?"
"Unfortunately, peak surcharges apply industry-wide during this period (Oct 5 - Jan 17). The good news is FirstMile's surcharges are significantly lower than competitors, so you're still getting the best rates available during peak season."

### "Will my base rates change?"
"No - your base Xparcel rates remain exactly the same. Peak surcharges are a temporary add-on during the busy season. After January 17, 2026, invoices will return to your standard rates."
