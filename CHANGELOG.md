All notable changes to the FirstMile Deals pipeline system.

## [3.0.1] - 2025-10-29

### ðŸŽ¯ Major Feature: Sync Continuity Chain

**Problem Solved**: Sync scripts operated independently, causing information loss between weekend comprehensive sync and Monday morning startup. User started Monday with stale context instead of weekend's prioritized action queue.

### Added

- **`daily_9am_sync.py` v2.0** - Context-aware day start with weekly continuity
  - New: `find_most_recent_weekly_sync()` - Automatically finds weekend comprehensive sync report
  - New: `extract_monday_action_queue()` - Parses Monday action queue from weekend report
  - New: Monday conditional logic - Shows weekend priorities FIRST on Monday mornings
  - Enhanced: Tue-Fri logic continues to show yesterday's pending items
  - Result: **Monday now starts with weekend's priority-scored action queue (Priority: 100, 95, 90)**

- **`eod_sync.py`** - End of day rollover script (NEW)
  - Extracts today's completed and pending items from `_DAILY_LOG.md`
  - Generates tomorrow's prioritized action queue
  - Writes to `FOLLOW_UP_REMINDERS.txt` (read by next 9AM sync)
  - Appends EOD summary to daily log
  - Result: **Zero information loss - incomplete items always roll to tomorrow**

- **`generate_improved_syncs.py`** - Sync script generator (NEW)
  - Solves: Shell escaping hell with large Python files containing emojis/quotes on Windows
  - Functions:
    - `generate_9am_sync_v2()` - Creates 9AM sync with continuity
    - `generate_eod_sync()` - Creates EOD rollover script
    - `update_weekly_sync_dynamic_dates()` - Updates weekly sync
  - Result: **Clean code generation without shell escaping issues**

- **`SYNC_CONTINUITY_FIX_COMPLETE.md`** - Complete documentation (NEW)
  - 200+ line comprehensive report
  - Problem analysis, solution design, testing results
  - Data flow diagrams, usage instructions, technical notes
  - Before/after metrics

### Changed

- **`end_of_week_sync_COMPLETE.py`** - Now uses dynamic date calculation
  - **Before**: `WEEK_START = "2025-10-20"` (hardcoded, manual updates required)
  - **After**: Auto-calculates last completed Monday-Friday week
  - Logic: Finds last Friday, calculates Monday of that week
  - Result: **Works for any week without manual date updates**

### Deprecated

- None

### Removed

- None

### Fixed

- **Sync Continuity Breakdown** - Weekend â†’ Monday information loss
  - Issue: Monday 9AM sync ignored weekend comprehensive sync, re-parsed stale logs
  - Fix: Added weekly sync detection and Monday action queue extraction
  - Impact: User now starts Monday with full context from weekend prioritization

- **No Daily Rollover** - Items could be forgotten between days
  - Issue: No systematic way to roll incomplete items to next day
  - Fix: Created `eod_sync.py` with automatic rollover to `FOLLOW_UP_REMINDERS.txt`
  - Impact: Tomorrow's 9AM sync always starts with today's incomplete items

- **Hardcoded Dates** - Weekly sync required manual date updates
  - Issue: `WEEK_START`/`WEEK_END` hardcoded as "2025-10-20"/"2025-10-25"
  - Fix: Dynamic calculation based on current date
  - Impact: Weekly sync works automatically for any week

### Security

- No security changes in this release

### Technical Notes

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… 9AM sync v2.0: Correctly detects Monday vs Tue-Fri, shows appropriate context (tested Wed Oct 29)
- âœ… EOD sync: Successfully extracts items and generates tomorrow's queue (tested Wed Oct 29)
- âœ… Weekly sync: Dynamic date calculation verified (logic tested, not run end-to-end)

**The Complete Continuity Chain**:
```
WEEKEND SYNC (creates Monday action queue)
    â†“
MONDAY 9AM (reads weekly sync FIRST, then adds live data)
    â†“
NOON (progress check)
    â†“
EOD (rolls over to tomorrow via FOLLOW_UP_REMINDERS.txt)
    â†“
TUESDAY 9AM (reads rollover, adds live data)
    â†“
... continues through week ...
    â†“
FRIDAY EOD â†’ WEEKEND SYNC (loops)
```

**Files in Continuity Chain**:
- `WEEKLY_SYNC_*_COMPLETE.md` - Monday action queue (weekend â†’ Monday)
- `FOLLOW_UP_REMINDERS.txt` - Tomorrow's priorities (today â†’ tomorrow)
- `_DAILY_LOG.md` - Continuous activity log (manual updates)
- HubSpot API - Live priority deals (every sync)

**Backup Files Created**:
- `daily_9am_sync_BACKUP_v1.py` - Original 9AM sync before v2.0

### Migration Notes

**For Users**:
1. No action required - all changes are backwards compatible
2. Continue using existing workflow commands
3. Monday morning will now automatically reference weekend sync

**Breaking Changes**: None

### Performance Impact

- 9AM sync: ~2 seconds (no change)
- EOD sync: <1 second (new script, very fast)
- Weekly sync: Same performance, just uses dynamic dates

### References

- Issue: Sync continuity breakdown reported Oct 28, 2025
- Fix: Implemented via `/sc:improve --scope project --focus quality --loop --iterations 2`
- Testing: Completed Oct 29, 2025
