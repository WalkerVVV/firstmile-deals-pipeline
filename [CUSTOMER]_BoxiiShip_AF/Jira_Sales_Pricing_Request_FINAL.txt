BACKGROUND AND GOALS:

Hi Sales! I need you to please create new Xparcel Domestic rates for BoxiiShip American Fork. They are meeting with Make Wellness tomorrow, October 10th, at 11am. Make Wellness is feeling the pinch of $45K-$50K above FirstMile costs per week after switching to UPS back in July.

Here's the situation: We lost Make Wellness in July 2025 due to performance issues in April (ACI-WS routing - now resolved). They were shipping 5,000 packages/day (25,000/week) with us generating $7.1M annual revenue. Since switching to UPS, they've been overpaying $45K-$50K every week - that's $1.17M-$1.3M thrown away over 26+ weeks. Now they're feeling the cost pain and the window is open to win them back.

The goal is to create aggressive Xparcel rates (Priority and Expedited, both National and Select) that beat their previous FirstMile rates and demonstrate massive savings versus their current UPS costs. Nate needs these rates in hand for tomorrow's 11am meeting.
