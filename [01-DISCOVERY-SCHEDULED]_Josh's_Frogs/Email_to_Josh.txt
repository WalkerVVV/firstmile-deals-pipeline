Subject: Josh's Frogs - FirstMile Xparcel Rate Analysis Complete

Hey Josh,

Quick update on your custom Xparcel rates - I've completed the full invoice audit analysis and the numbers look excellent.

With your 10K+ monthly volume (85% ground services), we're seeing strong savings opportunities:

• 55.9% average savings across all services
• $68,873/month savings potential ($826K annually)
• Cost per package drops from $12.55 to $5.54

Your current carrier mix (56% UPS, 38% FedEx, 6% USPS/Amazon) consolidates beautifully into FirstMile's National + Select networks. The lightweight package profile (60% under 1 lb) is perfect for our pricing structure - we're seeing 57-61% savings on cross-country zones.

Can we schedule a quick 15-min call this week to walk through the detailed breakdown? I've prepared a 9-tab analysis showing savings by carrier, service type, zone, and weight range.

Best,
Brett
