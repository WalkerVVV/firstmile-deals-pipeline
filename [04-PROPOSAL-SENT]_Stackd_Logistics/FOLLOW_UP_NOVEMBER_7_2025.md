## RECOMMENDED ACTION: NOVEMBER 7 FOLLOW-UP

### Approach Strategy

**TONE**: Direct but friendly, assumptive close, clear next step
**GOAL**: Get Landon on the phone THIS WEEK to discuss next steps
**TIMING**: Send today (Thursday), offer Friday or early next week meeting

### Email Option 1: Direct & Time-Sensitive

**Subject**: Stackd - Quick Check-In: Ready to Move Forward?

Landon,

Quick check-in on the FirstMile Xparcel proposal I sent last month.

**Recap**: $83,547 annual savings on your 16,836 monthly packages (9.5% cost reduction vs DHL).

I'm assuming one of three things happened:
1. **You're interested but timing got away** - Let's lock in a 15-minute call to discuss next steps
2. **You have questions about the analysis** - Happy to walk through any details
3. **Not the right time** - Totally understand, and I'll follow up in Q1 2026

**If #1 or #2**, what works better for you?
- **Friday 11/8**: 10 AM or 2 PM CST
- **Monday 11/11**: 9 AM or 3 PM CST
- **Tuesday 11/12**: 11 AM or 1 PM CST

**If #3**, just let me know and I'll reach back out after the holidays.

Either way, I'd appreciate knowing where your head's at so I can plan accordingly.

Best,
**Brett Walker**

### Email Option 2: Value Re-Statement

**Subject**: Stackd Logistics - $83K Savings Proposal: Where Do We Stand?

Landon,

Following up on the Xparcel rates I sent in October. I want to make sure this doesn't fall through the cracks if it's something you're still interested in.

**What you're looking at**:
- **$6,962/month savings** ($83,547 annually)
- **9.5% cost reduction** on your DHL eCommerce ground volume
- **ShipHero already integrated** - 7-10 days to first shipments
- **No pilot required** - straight to performance review cadence

**Peak Season Intel**: If you're locked into DHL through Q4 (which I totally understand), we should still talk in November about a Q1 2026 implementation. That way you avoid DHL's 2026 GRI and hit the ground running in January.

**What works for a quick call?**
- This week: Friday 11/8 (10 AM or 2 PM CST)
- Next week: Monday-Wednesday flexible

Or if this isn't a priority right now, just let me know and I'll follow up in January.

Thanks,
**Brett**

### Email Option 3: Simple & Direct

**Subject**: Stackd - Still Interested?

Landon,

Just circling back on the Xparcel proposal ($83K annual savings).

Still on your radar, or should I check back in January?

If you want to talk through it, I've got time this Friday or early next week.

## RECOMMENDED: Send Option 1 (Direct & Time-Sensitive)

**Why This Works**:
1. **Assumptive approach** - Gives Landon 3 clear paths without being pushy
2. **Acknowledges timing** - Shows you understand Q4 is busy
3. **Specific meeting times** - Makes it easy to say yes
4. **Graceful exit** - Option #3 lets him postpone without awkwardness
5. **Request for clarity** - "I'd appreciate knowing where your head's at" = professional nudge

---

## ALTERNATIVE: PHONE CALL APPROACH

If you prefer calling instead of emailing:

**Best Time to Call**: Friday 11/8 between 9-11 AM CST (3PLs are usually slower mid-morning Fridays)

**Opening Script**:
> "Hey Landon, it's Brett Walker from FirstMile. I sent over that Xparcel analysis last month showing about $83K in annual savings. I wanted to give you a quick call to see where your head's at on that. Do you have two minutes?"

**If He's Busy**:
> "No worries - when's a better time to catch you? I've got Friday afternoon or Monday/Tuesday morning wide open."

**If He's Interested**:
> "Great - let's lock in 15-20 minutes on your calendar. What works better: Friday afternoon or Monday/Tuesday morning?"

**If He's Not Interested**:
> "Totally understand. Can I ask if it's a timing thing or if something in the proposal didn't align with your needs? Either way, I appreciate the feedback."

## KEY DECISION POINTS FOR CALL

**Option A: Q4 2025 Start (Risky but Possible)**
- Pro: Immediate savings, beat DHL 2026 GRI
- Con: Peak season implementation risk
- Timeline: 7-10 days from paperwork = Dec 1 start earliest

**Option B: Q1 2026 Start (Recommended)**
- Pro: Clean post-holiday onboarding, avoid peak chaos
- Con: 2+ month delay in savings realization

### Questions to Ask Landon

1. **Volume Validation**: "Is your volume still tracking around 16,800 packages/month?"
2. **DHL Contract**: "When does your current DHL agreement renew?"
3. **Peak Season**: "Are you locked into DHL through Q4, or is there flexibility?"
4. **Integration**: "ShipHero is your current platform, correct? Any changes there?"
5. **Decision Timeline**: "If this makes sense financially, what's realistic for a start date?"
