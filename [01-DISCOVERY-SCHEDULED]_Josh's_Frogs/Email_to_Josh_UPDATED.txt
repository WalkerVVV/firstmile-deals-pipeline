Subject: Josh's Frogs - FirstMile Xparcel Savings Analysis Complete

Hey Josh,

I've completed the full analysis on your 6-month shipping data (175K shipments) and the FirstMile Xparcel opportunity is solid.

Here's what the numbers show:

**Current State:**
• 29,255 packages/month average
• $200,832/month in shipping costs
• 95% of your volume is serviceable by FirstMile (we can't handle overnight for live animals, which is only 5%)
• Current carrier mix: 62% USPS, 24% FedEx, 10% UPS

**FirstMile Xparcel Savings:**
• 12% average savings: **$24,100/month** ($289K annually)
• Your average cost per package drops from $7.22 to $6.35
• 46% of your volume is under 1 lb - perfect for our lightweight pricing

**Why this works for Josh's Frogs:**
Your shipping profile is ideal for FirstMile's dynamic routing. We consolidate your current 3-carrier mix into our National + Select networks, giving you:

• Single integration (one connection for all ground services)
• Audit Queue (blocks mis-rated labels before they hit your invoice)
• Single support thread (no more juggling carrier contacts for claims/returns)
• Rate card guarantee (no surprise surcharges)

**Next Steps:**
I've prepared a professional 6-tab analysis showing the breakdown by weight, zone, and current carrier. Can we schedule 15 minutes this week to walk through it?

I'll bring the detailed numbers and we can discuss implementation timeline (typically 2-3 weeks from kickoff to full cutover).

Best,
Brett Walker
FirstMile
