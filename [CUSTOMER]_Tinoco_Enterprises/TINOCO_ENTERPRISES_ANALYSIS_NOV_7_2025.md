## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Needed

**1. Get Current Cost Data** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Missing**: Actual carrier costs (USPS & UPS rates)
- **Need**: Invoice data or ShipStation cost reports
- **Why**: Cannot create accurate proposal without baseline costs
- **Action**: Request from Juan or Tinoco directly

**2. Clarify "Creating 2024 for them"** ⚠️ URGENT
- **Current Note**: "Creating 2024 for them - Coordinating with Juan"
- **Unclear**: What does "2024" mean? (Rates? Contract? Integration?)
- **23 Days Idle**: Need to understand why deal is stalled
- **Action**: Contact Juan for status update

**3. Understand Business Structure** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- **Two Brands**: Juggy and MexiStuff under Tinoco Enterprises
- **Questions**:
  - Separate shipping accounts or combined?
  - Separate P&Ls or consolidated?
  - Which brand is priority for conversion?
- **Action**: Clarify with Tinoco/Juan

### Information Gaps to Fill

**Missing Data**:
- [ ] Current USPS Ground Advantage rates
- [ ] Current UPS Ground rates
- [ ] Monthly spend breakdown (USPS vs UPS)
- [ ] Origin ZIP codes (where are they shipping from?)
- [ ] Business relationship: Who is Juan? (3PL? Operations Manager?)
- [ ] Decision maker: Who approves carrier changes?
- [ ] Integration platform: ShipStation? ShipHero? Other?
- [ ] Contract status: Are they locked into USPS contract?

**Next Actions**:
1. **Contact Juan** - Get status on "2024" project, request cost data
2. **Review HubSpot Deal Notes** - Full history of Juggy/Tinoco relationship
3. **Request Invoice Data** - Last 60-90 days of carrier invoices
4. **Identify Decision Maker** - Who has authority to switch carriers?

## 📋 FIRSTMILE POSITIONING STRATEGY

### Strengths for This Customer

**1. Volume Consistency**
- 4,838 packages/month combined (steady, predictable volume)
- Daily average: 166 packages/day (good operational rhythm)
- Two brands provide diversification

**2. Weight Profile Match**
- MexiStuff 17% sub-1 lb: FirstMile National Network sweet spot
- 1-5 lb tier: Xparcel Ground competitive with USPS Ground Advantage
- No expedited services currently: Opportunity to introduce Xparcel Expedited/Priority

**3. Carrier Simplification**
- Currently using USPS + UPS (two integrations)
- FirstMile: Single integration for Ground + Expedited + Priority
- Audit Queue: Blocks mis-rated labels before invoice

**4. 3PL/Multi-Brand Support** (if Juan is 3PL)
- FirstMile specializes in 3PL relationships
- Two brands can share single account or separate accounts
- Unified reporting across brands

### Competitive Challenges

**1. USPS Ground Advantage Entrenchment**
- 93% of volume already on USPS (established workflow)
- USPS Ground Advantage is competitive in 1-5 lb tier
- Switching cost: Integration effort and operational change

**2. Heavy Weight Concentration**
- 94% of Juggy in 1-5 lb tier: Limited optimization opportunity
- FirstMile savings stronger in sub-1 lb tier (only 17% of MexiStuff)
- Need to sharpen pencil on 1-5 lb tier pricing

**3. Information Deficit**
- Cannot build proposal without current cost data
- 23 days idle suggests low urgency or internal blocker
- Unclear what "Creating 2024 for them" means

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1: Information Gathering** (This Week)
1. Contact Juan - Status update on "2024" project
2. Request cost data - USPS invoices, UPS invoices, ShipStation reports
3. Identify decision maker - Who approves carrier changes?
4. Clarify business structure - Juggy vs MexiStuff relationship

**Phase 2: Analysis** (Next Week)
1. Run PLD analysis with actual cost data
2. Build FirstMile rate comparison (Xparcel Ground vs USPS Ground Advantage)
3. Calculate savings by brand (Juggy vs MexiStuff)
4. Identify optimization opportunities (sub-1 lb tier for MexiStuff)

**Phase 3: Proposal** (Week 3)
1. Create dual-brand proposal (Juggy + MexiStuff)
2. Show blended savings vs brand-specific savings
3. Include implementation timeline (ShipStation integration)
4. Offer pilot option: Start with one brand, expand to second

## 🎯 DEAL QUALIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Current Deal Status: [07-STARTED-SHIPPING]

**Questions to Answer**:
- [ ] **Are they actually shipping with FirstMile?** (Deal stage suggests yes, but need confirmation)
- [ ] **What services are they using?** (Xparcel Ground? DHL? Other?)
- [ ] **What volume is on FirstMile?** (All 4,838 packages/month or partial?)
- [ ] **Why 23 days idle?** (Onboarding complete? Issue to resolve? Low priority?)
- [ ] **What is "Creating 2024 for them"?** (2024 rates? New contract? Integration?)

### If They're Already Shipping (Likely Scenario)

**This changes everything**:
- Stage [07-STARTED-SHIPPING] suggests they're ALREADY a customer
- 23 days idle might be: Onboarding complete, monitoring performance
- "Creating 2024" might be: 2024 rate card renewal or Q1 2026 rates
- Fresh PLD data (Nov 7) suggests: Performance review or volume analysis

**New Approach**:
1. **Confirm Customer Status** - Are they shipping with FirstMile now?
2. **Review Performance** - How are they doing vs USPS/UPS?
3. **Identify Growth Opportunity** - Can we take more volume? (UPS 7%?)
4. **2024/2025 Rates** - Is this a rate renewal discussion?
5. **Volume Expansion** - Can we add MexiStuff if only Juggy is live?
