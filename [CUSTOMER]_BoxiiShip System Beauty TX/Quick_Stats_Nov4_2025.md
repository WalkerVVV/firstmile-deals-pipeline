## October 6 Deep Dive

### Broader Dataset (15,513 shipments - Domestic Transit Report)
- **Total Oct 6**: 1,990 shipments
- **Delivered**: 1,701 (85.5%)
- **NOT Delivered**: 289 (14.5%)

### Reid's Problem Sample (110 tracking numbers - Nov 3 file)
- **Total Oct 6**: 89 packages
- **Delivered**: 0 (0.0%)
- **NOT Delivered**: 89 (100%)

---

## CRITICAL INTERPRETATION

### Why the Discrepancy?

**Reid specifically sent PROBLEM tracking numbers** - the packages his SE Asia customers are complaining about.

**The Math**:
- Broader dataset: 289 Oct 6 packages still undelivered (14.5%)
- Reid's sample: 89 Oct 6 packages still undelivered (100% of his sample)
- **Reid's 89 packages represent ~31% of ALL Oct 6 failures**

**Implication**:
- The 85.5% delivery rate sounds good on paper
- But there are 289 catastrophic failures from Oct 6
- Reid's customers are experiencing the failures (89 of the 289)
- These failures = **zero scans in 28 days** = complete carrier breakdown

---

## FOR THE 1PM MEETING

### Use These Numbers
1. **Average days to first scan**: 2.9 days (but 38% take 3-7 days)
2. **Oct 6-17 overall**: 95.1% delivered (8,097 out of 8,513)
3. **Oct 6 specifically**: 85.5% delivered (1,701 out of 1,990)
4. **Oct 6 failures**: 289 packages still not delivered (14.5%)
5. **Reid's sample**: 89 packages from Oct 6, zero delivered after 28 days

### The Story
"While 95% of Oct 6-17 shipments are now delivered, **October 6 is a clear outlier at 85.5%**. Of the 289 Oct 6 packages still undelivered after 28 days, Reid's customers are directly impacted by at least 89 of them - and those 89 have **zero carrier scans**. This isn't just a delay - it's a complete acceptance failure."

## Comparison to Previous Analysis (Oct 31)

### Then (Oct 31 Analysis)
- 827 packages in-transit
- 142 Oct 6 packages showing "info received" (97.9% of tracked)

### Now (Nov 3 Data)
- 416 packages still not delivered from Oct 6-17
- 289 from Oct 6 specifically (14.5% failure rate)
- Reid's 89 packages: 100% unscanned, 100% undelivered

**Progress**: Some recovery occurred (827 → 416 remaining), but the hardest failures (289 from Oct 6) remain unresolved, including all 89 that Reid flagged.

**Data Sources**:
- Domestic Transit Report sheet: 15,513 shipments
- Oct 6-17 subset: 8,513 shipments
- Reid's Nov 3 tracking sample: 110 tracking numbers (89 from Oct 6)
