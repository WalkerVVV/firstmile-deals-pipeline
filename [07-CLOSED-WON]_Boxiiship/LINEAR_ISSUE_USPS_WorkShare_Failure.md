# LINEAR ISSUE: USPS Work Share CA Injection Failure

**Issue Title:** [CRITICAL] BoxiiShip AF - 186 Packages Stuck in USPS Work Share Injection
**Priority:** Urgent
**Labels:** customer-impact, routing-failure, usps-workshare, boxiiship
**Assignee:** Brett Walker

---

## Summary

186 packages shipped via ACI-WS (USPS Work Share) are stuck at the injection point between ACI facilities and USPS network. Packages show "Departed carrier facilities" but have no USPS acceptance scan, causing 100% SLA failure and customer threatening to switch carriers.

## Impact

- **Customer:** BoxiiShip American Fork (Make Wellness)
- **Revenue at Risk:** $2M deal closing June 30, 2025
- **Packages Affected:** 186 (all California destinations)
- **Business Impact:** 700+ end customers requiring reships
- **SLA Performance:** 0% on-time for affected packages

## Root Cause

1. **Service Type:** ACI-WS (USPS Work Share) not ACI Direct
2. **Failure Point:** USPS injection facilities in California
3. **Specific Issue:** CA USPS facilities overwhelmed, not accepting Work Share volume
4. **Tracking Gap:** Packages leave ACI but never enter USPS system

## Timeline

- **June 24:** Initial complaint from Make Wellness
- **June 25:** Analyzed tracking data, identified ACI-WS pattern
- **June 26:** Root cause identified - USPS injection failure
- **June 26:** Escalated to ACI Operations
- **June 26:** Implementing alternate routing

## Evidence

```
Package Status Analysis:
- Total CA packages: 186
- "Departed carrier facilities": 134 (72%)
- No USPS acceptance scan: 186 (100%)
- Average days in limbo: 7-15
- All packages: ACI-WS service type
```

## Actions Taken

1. **Immediate:**
   - ✓ Escalated to ACI Operations for package location
   - ✓ Created CA-specific routing rules
   - ✓ Notified internal team (Brock, Ryan, Nate)

2. **In Progress:**
   - [ ] Awaiting ACI facility list and package status
   - [ ] Configuring DHL eCommerce for CA
   - [ ] Setting up UPS Mail Innovations backup

3. **Planned:**
   - [ ] Remove ACI-WS from all CA routes
   - [ ] Daily monitoring of CA shipments
   - [ ] Weekly review of Work Share performance

## Resolution

### Short-term (Today):
- Remove ACI-WS from California routing
- Add premium carriers for CA destinations
- Get stuck packages moving via escalation

### Long-term (This Week):
- Diversify Work Share partners
- Implement facility capacity monitoring
- Create overflow routing rules

## Lessons Learned

1. **ACI-WS ≠ ACI Direct** - Work Share adds injection risk
2. **CA USPS capacity** is critically constrained
3. **Xparcel flexibility** allows immediate pivoting
4. **Monitoring gap** - Need injection point visibility

## Customer Communication

**Key Message:** "We've identified the exact failure point - USPS facilities in California are overwhelmed. We're implementing three immediate fixes: removing problematic routing, adding premium carriers, and daily monitoring. This is why Xparcel's flexibility matters."

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Document final resolution
- [ ] Calculate customer credits if needed
- [ ] Update routing rules permanently
- [ ] Share findings with sales team
