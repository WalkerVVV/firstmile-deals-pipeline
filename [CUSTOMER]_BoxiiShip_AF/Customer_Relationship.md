## Root Cause Analysis

### Performance Collapse Timeline

**April 24-28, 2025**: Critical 5-day failure period
- **Total Packages Affected**: 7,280 packages (83.2% of all April issues)
- **Peak Failure Day**: April 28 - 2,036 packages delayed (23.27% of daily volume)
- **Geographic Impact**:
  - California: 1,021 packages
  - Texas: 1,545 packages
  - Arizona: 178 packages
- **SLA Deviation**: Promised 1-3 days → Actual 5-8 days delivery
- **On-Time Performance**: 53% (47% failure rate)

### Technical Root Cause

**ACI-WS Routing Configuration Issue**:
- ACI-WS (West Sacramento facility) added to Xparcel Priority routing
- Inadequate transit buffers for: linehaul + cross-dock + processing time
- 95% ZIP limit too broad for ACI-WS operational capabilities
- No validation of actual transit times before activation

### Customer Impact

**Operational Impact**:
- 700+ orders delivered outside SLA window
- Double-shipping costs: Make Wellness reshipped all failed orders via UPS
- Customer service crisis: High volume of customer complaints
- Brand damage: Late deliveries during critical fulfillment period

**Direct Customer Feedback** (Quote from Erica at Make Wellness):
> "This is a joke! I've been getting more and more calls on this... it all points to FirstMile in these places SUCK! I will sort the file going forward and make sure we send these UPS in these states."

### Resolution & Post-Mortem

**Technical Fix Implemented (May 1, 2025)**:
- **FAST Group Network Integration**: FirstMile, ACI, and Sindel unified as one network
- **ZIP Limit Controls**: Strict ZIP limits to ensure delivery performance (90-95% by Day 3 for Priority/Exp Plus, by Day 5 for Expedited)
- Performance stabilized to pre-April levels
- **White Glove Service**: Weekly touchbase meetings, weekly transit monitoring, dedicated account oversight

**Critical Gap**:
- Customer left in July 2025 before seeing May improvements
- Performance was stable May-July but trust was broken
- Never calculated/offered service credits for 700+ late packages
- No proactive win-back communication after resolution

---

## Current Competitive Analysis

### Customer's Current UPS Premium
- **Weekly Cost**: $45K-$50K above FirstMile equivalent rates
- **26+ Weeks Since Exit**: $1.17M-$1.3M total premium paid (July-October)
- **Annual Premium**: $2.34M-$2.6M vs FirstMile rates

### FirstMile Competitive Position
- **Rate Advantage**: $45K-$50K/week lower than UPS
- **Performance Status**: April issues resolved, stable since May 2025
- **Service Credits Owed**: 700+ packages from April failure (never reconciled)

## Risk Assessment

### Risks to Win-Back

- **Gradual Ramp**: Offer pilot program (partial volume) to rebuild trust
- **Executive Sponsorship**: Senior leadership commitment to account success
