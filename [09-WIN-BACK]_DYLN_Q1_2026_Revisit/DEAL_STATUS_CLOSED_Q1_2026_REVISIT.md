# DYLN Deal Status - Closed for Q1 2026 Revisit

**Date**: November 3, 2025
**Status**: CLOSED - Postponed to Q1 2026
**Deal Value**: $3,600,000
**Original Stage**: [03-RATE-CREATION]

---

## Closure Reason

DYLN reached out to DHL directly and received rates independently. We cannot provide competitive Xparcel rates when bundled with DHL, as customer has already established direct DHL relationship.

---

## Business Context

- **RATE-1907**: Marked as complete/not pursued
- Customer obtained DHL rates directly from carrier
- FirstMile/Xparcel rates not competitive when customer has direct DHL contract
- No value proposition for Xparcel bundled service in this scenario

---

## Next Steps

**Q1 2026 Revisit**:
- Calendar reminder for January 2026
- Re-engage to discuss shipping needs and carrier performance
- Evaluate if direct DHL relationship is meeting expectations
- Consider standalone Xparcel domestic rates (non-DHL bundled)

---

## Follow-Up Date

**Target**: January 15, 2026
**Action**: Reach out to assess DHL performance and shipping needs
**Opportunity**: Standalone Xparcel proposal for domestic volume
