# HUBSPOT REAL-TIME UPDATE WORKFLOW
**Keeping HubSpot in sync throughout the day**

---

## üéØ PHILOSOPHY

**As we work through the day, I automatically update HubSpot to keep records current.**

Every action you complete triggers a HubSpot update:
- Email sent ‚Üí Log in HubSpot
- Call completed ‚Üí Log notes in HubSpot
- Deal moves stages ‚Üí Update in HubSpot
- Next steps identified ‚Üí Create tasks in HubSpot

**You focus on the work. I handle the documentation.**

## üîÑ AUTOMATIC UPDATE TRIGGERS

### When You Say: "Stackd email sent!"
**I automatically do:**
1. Log email in HubSpot deal
2. Add note with email subject and key points
3. Create follow-up task for response check (3-5 days)
4. Update deal last contact date

**Example:**
```python
python hubspot_realtime_updates.py email "Stackd Logistics" \
  --subject "FirstMile Xparcel Rates - 10.2% Savings Proposal" \
  --direction OUTBOUND \
  --text "Sent rates workbook with $4,522/month savings. Awaiting response."
```

### When You Say: "Just got off call with Reid at BoxiiShip"
**I ask you:**
- "How did the call go? What were the key points?"

**Then I do:**
1. Log call in HubSpot with your notes
2. Add deal note with call summary
3. Create tasks for any action items discussed
4. Update next contact date if scheduled

**Example:**
```python
python hubspot_realtime_updates.py call "BoxiiShip" \
  --text "Discussed ACI Direct routing activation. Reid confirmed encoding fix is working. Need to follow up with Melissa by EOD. Next call scheduled for Thursday 10am." \
  --outcome COMPLETED
```

### When You Say: "Move Tactical Logistic to Closed Won!"
**I automatically do:**
1. Update deal stage in HubSpot to [07-CLOSED-WON]
2. Add note documenting the win
3. Set close date to today
4. Create onboarding tasks if needed

**Example:**
```python
python hubspot_realtime_updates.py stage "Tactical Logistic" \
  --stage "[07-CLOSED-WON]"

python hubspot_realtime_updates.py note "Tactical Logistic" \
  --text "CLOSED WON - Setup complete, first shipment processed successfully. Customer confirmed ready for production volume."
```

### When We Identify Next Steps
**I automatically do:**
1. Create HubSpot task with clear subject
2. Set priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. Set due date based on urgency
4. Associate with deal

**Example:**
```python
python hubspot_realtime_updates.py task "Upstate Prep" \
  --subject "Make final rate decision: complete or close-lost" \
  --body "48 days in rate creation stage. Need decision to clear bottleneck. Review customer responsiveness and close-lost if no engagement." \
  --priority HIGH \
  --due_days 1
```
