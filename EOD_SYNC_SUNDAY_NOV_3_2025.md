## ✅ WHAT WAS COMPLETED TODAY

### 1. Weekly Priorities Document Created ✅
**File**: `WEEKLY_PRIORITIES_2025-11-03_to_2025-11-08.md`

**🎯 CRITICAL CONTEXT CAPTURED**:

**BoxiiShip Ground Advantage Clarification** (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH):
- ✅ Confirmed: BoxiiShip uses **FirstMile's GA Program** (NOT Sendle)
- ✅ Historical context: Legacy FirstMile customer (2+ years before Fast Group merger)
- ✅ Lindsay's confusion resolved: "Is this client setup for GA through their FM setup?"
- ✅ **ANSWER DOCUMENTED**: FirstMile Ground Advantage Program (legacy customer)
- ✅ Action items created for Monday verification

**8 Weekly Priorities Documented**:

**🚨 CRITICAL** (Complete by EOD Tuesday):
1. BoxiiShip communication (2 days overdue - credit approval follow-up)
2. DYLN rate verification (15+ days overdue, $3.6M at risk in [03-RATE-CREATION])
3. Josh's Frogs meeting confirmation (hot lead awaiting response)

**📊 HIGH PRIORITY** (This Week):
4. Process 10 Brand Scout reports → HubSpot (AG1, Ritual, Seed Health priority)
5. [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] follow-ups (9 deals needing attention)
6. [03-RATE-CREATION] bottleneck (3 deals stuck: Pendulums, eSafety, DYLN)

**🔄 PIPELINE MAINTENANCE** (Ongoing):
7. [09-WIN-BACK] re-engagement (8 deals, $235.3M opportunity)
8. HubSpot pipeline sync (daily updates)

---

### 2. Cold Lead Organization ✅
**Problem Solved**: 16 cold leads cluttering daily priority reports

**Actions Completed**:
- ✅ Created `_LEADS/` folder structure
- ✅ Moved 16 [00-LEAD] folders to `_LEADS/`
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to track but exclude from daily scans
- ✅ Created `_LEADS/README.md` documenting organization system

**Impact**: Prioritization agent now shows accurate 30 active deals (not 46)

---

### 3. Repository & System Fixes ✅
**Critical Fixes Completed**:
- ✅ All 17 MCP servers verified connected and operational
- ✅ Git repository synced (clean working tree)
- ✅ File system organized (cold leads separated)
- ✅ Daily sync scripts operational

**Technical Achievement**:
- Fixed prioritization agent regex bug (was showing 0 deals)

- Cold leads no longer clutter daily priorities
