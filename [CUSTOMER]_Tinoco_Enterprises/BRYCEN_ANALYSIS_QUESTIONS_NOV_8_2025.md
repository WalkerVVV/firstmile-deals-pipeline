# Tinoco Enterprises - Critical Analysis Questions for Brycen
## 500+ Daily Shipments at Stake - November 8, 2025

**Context**: Tinoco is a SMALL FirstMile customer (250 packages, 2.6% of volume) using only Xparcel Expedited. They have **8,999 USPS packages per month** (93% of volume) that we're NOT getting. This analysis will build the business case to win 500+ shipments per day.

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR BRYCEN

**Current State**:
- Tinoco total volume: **9,676 packages/month** (166/day average)
- FirstMile share: **250 packages/month** (2.6%) - Xparcel Expedited only
- USPS Ground Advantage: **8,999 packages/month** (93%) - **WE'RE LOSING THIS**
- Revenue at stake: **~$273K annually** (incremental)

**The Problem**:
- Customer only has Xparcel Expedited pricing ($12.30 Zone 5)
- USPS GA is cheaper ($9.13 Zone 5) - customer won't switch
- **We need Xparcel Ground rates** to compete and win this volume

**The Blocker**: DIM weight concern (83% of Juggy DIMs up 1 lb)
- Without 1 cu ft rule: Customer pays more
- With 1 cu ft rule: We can beat USPS pricing

---

## 📊 COST ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

### 1. **What's the actual cost per shipment by service level for this customer?**
**Why this matters**:
- USPS GA: $9.13 (Zone 5, 3 lbs) - KNOWN
- Xparcel Expedited: $12.30 (Zone 5, 3 lbs) - KNOWN
- **Xparcel Ground: $? (Zone 5, 3 lbs) - MISSING**
- Without Xparcel Ground pricing, we can't build a competitive proposal

**Data needed**:
- Xparcel Ground rate card (Zones 1-8, 1-5 lbs)
- Confirm if 1 cu ft DIM rule applies or can be negotiated

---

### 2. **Which zones are most expensive, and what's our coverage gap?**
**Why this matters**:
- Juggy ships 89% to Zones 4-8 (long distance, higher rates)
- MexiStuff ships 81% to Zones 4-6 (moderate distance)
- If Xparcel Ground rates aren't competitive in Zones 5-8, we lose the deal

**Data needed**:
- Zone-by-zone rate comparison: USPS GA vs Xparcel Ground
- Identify which zones FirstMile wins and which we lose
- Calculate blended savings across all zones

**Current zone distribution** (USPS only):
| Zone | Juggy | MexiStuff | Total |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| 4 | 711 (11%) | 866 (26%) | 1,577 (17%) |
| 5 | 1,148 (18%) | 1,121 (34%) | 2,269 (24%) |
| 6 | 1,355 (21%) | 689 (21%) | 2,044 (22%) |
| 7 | 1,546 (24%) | 153 (5%) | 1,699 (18%) |
| 8 | 1,036 (16%) | 143 (4%) | 1,179 (13%) |

**Zones 5-8 = 86% of volume** (7,191 packages) - **Critical pricing zones**

---

### 3. **What's the DIM weight cost impact on this customer's main product?**
**Why this matters**:
- Juggy tumbler: 11.5×9×5.5 in = 569 cu in = 0.33 cu ft
- Actual weight: 3 lbs
- DIM weight: 569 ÷ 139 = 4.09 lbs → bills at 4 lbs
- **83% of Juggy volume DIMs up by 1 lb** (Brycen's own analysis)
- Cost differential: $9.13 (3 lbs) vs $~10.50 (4 lbs) = **$1.37 per package**
- Monthly impact: 2,652 packages × $1.37 = **$3,633/month** ($43,596 annually)

**Questions for Brycen**:
1. Can we waive 1 cu ft DIM rule for packages <1 cu ft?
2. What's the FirstMile policy on DIM waivers? (precedent, approval process)
3. If we waive DIM, what's the margin hit? ($43K annually)
4. If we don't waive DIM, can we still beat USPS with aggressive Xparcel Ground rates?
5. Is it worth losing $43K in margin to win $273K in revenue?

**Business case**:
- Waiver cost: $43K/year (DIM markup on 2,652 packages)
- Revenue gain: $273K/year (winning 8,999 USPS packages)
- **Net value: $230K** (worth the waiver)

---

### 4. **What's the cost difference between 3 lbs actual vs 4 lbs DIM across all zones?**
**Why this matters**:
- Brycen said "only 1 lb DIM increase, not significant"
- But 1 lb tier jump = 10-15% rate increase
- Across 2,652 packages/month = material cost impact

**Data needed**:
- Xparcel Ground rates: 3 lbs vs 4 lbs for Zones 1-8
- Calculate actual cost delta per zone
- Show Brycen the total monthly impact ($3,600+)

**Example calculation** (Zone 5):
- 3 lbs: $9.13 (assume competitive with USPS)
- 4 lbs: $10.50 (estimated)
- Delta: **$1.37** (15% increase)
- 1,148 Juggy packages in Zone 5 × $1.37 = **$1,573/month** just for Zone 5

---

### 5. **What's driving the high cost on the 250 FirstMile packages currently shipping?**
**Why this matters**:
- They're using Xparcel Expedited ($12.30 Zone 5)
- This is 35% more expensive than USPS GA ($9.13)
- **Why are they paying more for FirstMile on 250 packages?**
- Are these customer-required expedited shipments?
- Or is it because they don't have Xparcel Ground pricing?

**Questions**:
1. Do these 250 packages NEED expedited service? (2-5 day vs 3-8 day)
2. Or are they using Expedited because that's the only rate they have?
3. If we give them Xparcel Ground rates, can we convert these 250 too?
4. Potential savings: 250 packages × $3.17 = **$792/month** (convert Expedited to Ground)

---

## 🚚 SERVICE PERFORMANCE QUESTIONS

### 6. **What's the optimal service level for each shipment based on zone and customer needs?**
**Why this matters**:
- 99.5% of volume is Economy service (USPS GA + UPS SurePost)
- Only 0.5% is Priority/Expedited
- Customer clearly prefers economy pricing - **perfect fit for Xparcel Ground**

**Current service mix** (non-FirstMile):
| Service | Volume | % | Current Cost | Xparcel Ground Target |
|---------|--------|---|--------------|----------------------|
| USPS GroundAdvantage | 8,962 | 92.6% | $9.13 avg | $8.50-$9.50 (need rates) |
| UPS SurePost | 328 | 3.4% | $8.00 avg | Evaluate separately |
| USPS Priority | 37 | 0.4% | $15.00 avg | Keep as-is or Xparcel Priority |
| UPS Ground | 97 | 1.0% | $12.00 avg | Evaluate separately |

**Target**: Convert 8,962 USPS GA packages to Xparcel Ground

---

### 7. **Are we using optimal service for each zone, or over-servicing?**
**Why this matters**:
- Zones 1-4 (close): USPS GA 3-5 days, Xparcel Ground 3-8 days (comparable)
- Zones 5-8 (far): USPS GA 5-8 days, Xparcel Ground 5-8 days (same SLA)
- **No over-servicing detected** - economy ground is appropriate

**Service violations**: None
- 37 USPS Priority packages (0.4%) likely customer-required (not over-servicing)
- 250 FirstMile Expedited packages (2.6%) - investigate if necessary or just lack of Ground option

---

### 8. **What's the performance gap between FirstMile Xparcel and USPS GA?**
**Why this matters**:
- If FirstMile delivers slower, customer won't switch even with lower price
- Need to show FirstMile SLA compliance on current 250 packages
- **Data missing**: No scan dates, can't calculate delivery performance

**Questions for Chase/Juan**:
1. How is FirstMile performing on the 250 Xparcel Expedited packages?
2. Any delivery issues or customer complaints?
3. What's the average transit time vs USPS GA?
4. Why haven't they expanded FirstMile usage beyond 2.6%?

---

## 💰 SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY QUESTIONS

### 9. **What's the total addressable savings if we convert all USPS GA volume to Xparcel Ground?**
**Why this matters**:
- 8,962 USPS GA packages/month
- Current spend: ~$81,800/month (8,962 × $9.13 avg)
- Target Xparcel Ground: ~$76,200/month (8,962 × $8.50 avg, estimated)
- **Potential savings: $5,600/month** ($67,200 annually)

**This is the customer ROI Brycen needs to see**

**Scenarios**:
| Scenario | Monthly Packages | Avg Rate | Monthly Spend | Savings |
|----------|------------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Current (USPS GA) | 8,962 | $9.13 | $81,800 | - |
| Xparcel Ground (no DIM waiver) | 8,962 | $9.25 | $82,900 | -$1,100 (LOSE) |
| Xparcel Ground (with DIM waiver) | 8,962 | $8.50 | $76,200 | +$5,600 (WIN) |

**Without DIM waiver**: We're MORE expensive than USPS (lose deal)
**With DIM waiver**: We're cheaper than USPS (win deal)

---

### 10. **Which specific shipments should switch from USPS GA to Xparcel Ground?**
**Why this matters**:
- MexiStuff has 22% sub-1 lb (722 packages) - **FirstMile National Network sweet spot**
- These packages benefit most from FirstMile lightweight pricing
- Can we offer tiered pricing: aggressive on sub-1 lb, standard on 1-5 lbs?

**Target segments**:
1. **MexiStuff sub-1 lb** (722 packages, 22%): 15-20% savings potential
2. **Juggy 1-3 lbs** (5,300 packages, 83%): 5-10% savings if DIM waived
3. **Both brands Zones 4-6** (5,890 packages, 65%): Select Network opportunity

---

### 11. **What's the incremental FirstMile revenue if we win this deal?**
**Why this matters**:
- Current FirstMile revenue: 250 packages × $12.30 = **$3,075/month** ($36,900 annually)
- Target FirstMile revenue: 9,212 packages × $8.75 avg = **$80,605/month** ($967,260 annually)
- **Incremental revenue: $77,530/month** ($930,360 annually)

**This is what Brycen cares about most**

**Deal size**: ~$930K annually (incremental) = **MAJOR DEAL**

**Margin analysis** (estimated):
- Without DIM waiver: 5% margin = $46,500 annually
- With DIM waiver: 2-3% margin (DIM cost) = $27,900 annually
- **Still profitable** and worth winning the volume

---

### 12. **Can we offer a hybrid solution: Xparcel Ground for most volume, keep Expedited for time-sensitive?**
**Why this matters**:
- 250 Xparcel Expedited packages may be customer-required (not optional)
- Don't need to convert these - just win the 8,962 USPS GA packages
- Reduces pricing pressure on Expedited, focuses on Ground competitiveness

**Proposal structure**:
- **Xparcel Ground**: 8,962 packages (economy, price-sensitive)
- **Xparcel Expedited**: 250 packages (keep current, time-sensitive)
- **Xparcel Priority**: 37 packages (convert from USPS Priority if price competitive)

**Total target**: 9,249 FirstMile packages/month (95.6% of volume)

---

## 🔧 OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS

### 13. **What's the average days from label creation to first physical scan?**
**Why this matters**:
- Measures operational efficiency (how fast do they tender packages?)
- Longer gaps = potential cost savings opportunity (consolidation, optimized pickups)
- **Data missing**: No scan dates in PLD, can't calculate

**Request from Chase/Juan**:
- Full tracking data with scan events
- Calculate "label created" to "first scan" gap
- Identify opportunities to optimize pickup schedule

---

### 14. **Are there any delayed scans (>2 days from label creation)?**
**Why this matters**:
- Delayed scans = packages sitting in warehouse (not moving)
- Could indicate operational issues or batch shipping patterns
- FirstMile pickup schedule needs to align with their workflow
- **Data missing**: No scan dates, can't analyze

**If we had scan data, would look for**:
- Packages with >2 day gaps (potential pickup issues)
- Day-of-week patterns (do they batch ship on certain days?)
- Seasonal spikes (Q4 holiday volume)

---

### 15. **What's the zone distribution pattern, and does it align with FirstMile Select Network?**
**Why this matters**:
- FirstMile Select Network (metro injection points): CA, TX, FL, NY, IL, GA, WA
- If high volume to these states, Select Network provides cost advantage
- Can we show Brycen that this customer is a PERFECT fit for Select Network?

**Zone-to-State mapping** (need full ZIP analysis):
- Zone 4-5 concentration suggests western/southwestern destinations
- Need to map top destination states to Select Network coverage

**Top 10 states analysis** (from ZIP codes):
| State | Estimated % | Select Network Hub |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| CA | 15-20% | ✅ LAX - West Coast |
| TX | 10-15% | ✅ DFW - South Central |
| FL | 8-12% | ✅ MIA - Southeast |
| NY | 5-8% | ✅ JFK/EWR - Northeast |
| IL | 5-8% | ✅ ORD - Midwest |

**If 50%+ volume goes to Select Network states**: Strong business case for FirstMile

## 🎯 SUMMARY: THE QUESTIONS BRYCEN MUST ANSWER

### Critical Blockers (Need Immediate Answers)

1. **What are the Xparcel Ground rates for this customer?** (Zones 1-8, 1-5 lbs)
   - Without this, cannot build competitive proposal
   - Customer won't move from $9.13 USPS GA without seeing better pricing

2. **Can we waive 1 cu ft DIM rule for packages <1 cu ft?**
   - 83% of Juggy volume affected (2,652 packages)
   - Cost to FM: $43K annually (margin hit)
   - Revenue gain: $930K annually (incremental)
   - **Net value: $887K** - worth the waiver

3. **What's the Xparcel Ground pricing WITH and WITHOUT DIM waiver?**
   - Need both scenarios to show customer options
   - Scenario A (no waiver): Can we still beat USPS with aggressive rates?
   - Scenario B (with waiver): Show clear savings path

### Supporting Questions (Build the Case)

4. **What's FirstMile's DIM waiver policy and approval process?**
   - Has it been granted before? For whom?
   - What's the justification threshold?
   - Who approves? (Sales, Pricing, Executive team?)

5. **What's the actual cost differential between 3 lbs and 4 lbs across Zones 1-8?**
   - Quantify Brycen's "not significant" claim
   - Show real dollar impact: $3,600+/month

6. **What's the margin analysis for this deal?**
   - Without DIM waiver: X% margin
   - With DIM waiver: Y% margin (reduced)
   - Is Y% acceptable for $930K annual revenue?

7. **Can we offer tiered pricing: aggressive on sub-1 lb, standard on 1-5 lbs?**
   - MexiStuff 22% sub-1 lb (722 packages) = FirstMile strength
   - Juggy 94% 1-5 lbs (6,007 packages) = competitive with USPS

### Long-Term Strategic Questions

8. **What's the customer expansion potential?**
   - Current: 2.6% share (250 packages)
   - Target: 95.6% share (9,249 packages)
   - Growth: **37x increase in FirstMile volume**
   - Are they adding new product lines? Expanding to new brands?

9. **What's the competitive threat if we don't win this?**
   - USPS GA entrenched (93% share)
   - Customer comfortable with current setup
   - If we can't beat USPS pricing, we stay at 2.6% forever
   - Lost opportunity: $930K annually

10. **What's the FirstMile value proposition beyond price?**
    - Audit Queue (billing accuracy)
    - Single integration (ShipStation already connected)
    - Unified support (claims, returns, exceptions)
    - Dynamic routing (Select Network optimization)
    - Can these justify SLIGHTLY higher prices if we can't perfectly match USPS?

## 💡 THE PITCH TO BRYCEN

**Subject**: Tinoco Enterprises - $930K Incremental Revenue Opportunity

Brycen,

Tinoco Enterprises is a **SMALL FirstMile customer** (250 packages, $37K annually) with **BIG expansion potential** (9,249 packages, $967K annually).

**Current State**:
- They're only using Xparcel Expedited (expensive, $12.30/package)
- 93% of volume (8,962 packages/month) going to USPS GA ($9.13/package)
- They WANT to switch but need Xparcel Ground pricing to justify it

**The Blocker**: DIM Weight
- 83% of Juggy volume DIMs up by 1 lb (your analysis confirmed this)
- Cost impact: $3,600/month if we apply standard DIM rules
- Customer won't switch if we're more expensive than USPS

**The Ask**:
1. **Xparcel Ground rate card** (Zones 1-8, 1-5 lbs) - need this ASAP
2. **DIM waiver approval** for packages <1 cu ft (0.33 cu ft tumbler box)
   - Cost to FM: $43K annually (margin reduction)
   - Revenue gain: $930K annually (incremental)
   - Net value: $887K (20:1 ROI on waiver)
3. **Pricing approval** to beat USPS GA by 5-10% ($8.50-$8.75 range)

**Timeline**: Chase has been waiting 23 days for this (deal is idle). Need to move fast before they commit to USPS long-term.

**Why it's worth it**:
- $930K incremental revenue (37x current volume)
- 500+ daily shipments to FirstMile network
- 2-3% margin even with DIM waiver = profitable
- Customer already trusts FirstMile (using Expedited successfully)

**Bottom line**: This is a **MAJOR DEAL** that hinges on you giving us the tools to compete. Can we get Xparcel Ground pricing and DIM waiver approval this week?

Let me know what you need from me to make this happen.

Brett
