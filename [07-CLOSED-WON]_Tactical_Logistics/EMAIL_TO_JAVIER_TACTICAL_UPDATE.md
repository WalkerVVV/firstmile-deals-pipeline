## Email Content

Javier & Ely,

Quick check-in on **Tactical Logistics** reactivation status.

## Current Situation
We have Tactical Logistics marked as a closed-won customer who:
- Started shipping with FirstMile
- Paused operations
- Planning to restart shipping

## Questions:
1. **Timeline**: When is Tactical Logistics planning to resume shipping?
2. **Volume**: What are we expecting for monthly volume when they restart?
3. **Integration Status**: Do they need any technical support to reactivate?
4. **Account Setup**: Are there any changes to their original setup/rates?
5. **Contact**: Who is my main contact at Tactical Logistics for coordination?

## My Goal:
I want to make sure we're ready for their reactivation and provide any support needed to get them back online smoothly.

Let me know when you have a chance to sync on this. Happy to jump on a quick call if that's easier.

Thanks,
Brett
