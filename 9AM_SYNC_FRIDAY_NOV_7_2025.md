## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS & SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

### Chrome MCP Configuration Fix (This Session)
**Problem**: MCP calls were timing out consistently
**Root Cause**: Configuration used `"transport": "http"` instead of `"type": "streamableHttp"`
**Solution**: Updated `claude_desktop_config.json` with correct property
**Result**: ✅ Chrome MCP now working, Superhuman inbox accessible

**Location**: `C:\Users\BrettWalker\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json:63-66`

### Daily Log Stale Detection (Nov 5)
**Problem**: 9AM sync showing 13-day-old context as current
**Solution**: Added content-based date parsing and stale data warnings
**Result**: ✅ Sync now warns when log is >3 days old and shows live data instead

### Prioritization Agent v2.0 (Nov 4)
**Problem**: Agent showed 0 deals despite 46+ active pipeline
**Solution**: Rebuilt to query HubSpot API directly instead of folder scanning
**Result**: ✅ Now shows 30 active deals correctly with live data
