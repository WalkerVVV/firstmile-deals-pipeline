Hi Suyog,

I have great news ‚Äì **ACI has been officially removed from Driftaway Coffee's FirstMile setup** as of October 2nd, 2025. Your domestic shipments will now route exclusively through DHL, exactly as they did before this issue started.

## What This Means

**Immediate Changes**:
- All domestic shipments route through DHL only (your original configuration)
- No ACI carrier in the routing mix
- Tracking will work as expected on the familiar DHL portal
- No more packages being missorted or set aside at facilities

**Your Setup is Back to Normal**: We've restored your account to the DHL-only configuration you had for years before this incident.

## Outstanding Shipments

I'm personally tracking down the remaining **31 packages** from the original 46 affected shipments. I'll send you a detailed status update by **Monday, October 7th** with:
- Current location of each package
- Expected return timeline
- Next steps for each shipment

The 15 packages that were already returned should now be back with you.

## Let's Meet Next Week

I'd like to schedule a 30-minute call **early next week** (Monday Oct 7 or Tuesday Oct 8) to discuss:

1. **Service Resumption Plan**
   - Your comfort level restarting domestic FirstMile shipments
   - Testing approach (small batch first, then scale up?)
   - Any specific requirements or guardrails you need

2. **Performance Monitoring & Guarantees**
   - 100% scan compliance monitoring for your first batches
   - Weekly performance reports for the next 30 days
   - SLA guarantees during recovery period
   - Direct escalation path (my cell: 402-718-4727)

3. **Regularly Scheduled Touchpoints**
   - Weekly check-ins during first month
   - Bi-weekly after that (or frequency you prefer)
   - Monthly performance reviews with full analytics

4. **Remaining Issues Resolution**
   - Status of the 31 outstanding packages
   - Any customer complaints still pending
   - Documentation for your end-customers about what happened

5. **Process Improvements We've Made**
   - Setup change notification protocol (won't happen again)
   - Enhanced carrier routing validation
   - Faster support response SLAs

**Schedule Our Call**:
[Insert Calendly Link or Meeting Scheduler]

Or reply with your availability Monday/Tuesday and I'll send a calendar invite.

## My Personal Commitment

Suyog, I want to personally apologize for this incident. ACI was added to your setup without your knowledge or mine, and that's unacceptable. We've documented this failure internally and implemented process changes to ensure setup modifications require customer notification going forward.

Here's what I'm committing to you:
- **Direct access to me**: Cell 402-718-4727 for any issues
- **100% transparency**: Weekly reports on every shipment during recovery
- **Proactive monitoring**: I'll catch issues before you have to call them in
- **Fast escalation**: Any problems go straight to leadership

I know rebuilding trust takes time, but I'm confident we can get there together. Your international shipments have continued without issue, and I want your domestic service to perform just as reliably.

## Questions Before We Meet?

If you have any immediate questions or concerns before our call, please don't hesitate to reach out:
- **Email**: Brett.Walker@firstmile.com
- **Cell**: 402-718-4727 (call or text)
- **Account Manager**: Melissa at myaccountmanager@firstmile.com

I'm available all day Friday and over the weekend if you need anything urgent.

Looking forward to reconnecting next week and getting Driftaway Coffee back to 100% with FirstMile.
