## XPARCEL ZIP LIMIT IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Analysis Date: October 29, 2025
**Data Source**: October 1-20, 2025 PLD (11,167 shipments)
**Origin Point**: 761 (Beaumont/Port Arthur, TX)

### ZIP Limit Coverage
**Xparcel Network Coverage from Origin 761**:
- **Xparcel Ground**: 2,863 eligible destination ZIPs
- **Xparcel Expedited**: 2,804 eligible destination ZIPs
- **Ground-Only ZIPs**: 59 ZIPs (Expedited not available - too far for 5-day SLA)

### Current Carrier Mix (Before ZIP Limits)

| Carrier | Shipments | % Volume | Avg Weight (oz) |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **DHL** | 6,531 | **58.5%** | 12.15 |
| **ACI** | 4,634 | **41.5%** | 11.81 |

**Total Volume**: 11,167 shipments

### Volume Shift After ZIP Limits Applied

#### **WORST CASE SCENARIO** (Ineligible ACI shipments move to DHL)

| Carrier | Shipments | % Volume | Change from Current |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **ACI** | 4,528 | **40.5%** | ⬇️ **-106 shipments (-1.0%)** |
| **DHL** | 6,637 | **59.4%** | ⬆️ **+106 shipments (+0.9%)** |

**Impact Summary**:
- **ACI loses**: 106 shipments (2.3% of current ACI volume)
- **DHL gains**: 106 shipments
- **New split**: ACI 40.5% / DHL 59.4%

#### **BEST CASE SCENARIO** (BoxiiShip consolidates ACI-eligible volume)

| Carrier | Shipments | % Volume | Change from Current |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **ACI** | 6,157 | **55.1%** | ⬆️ **+1,523 shipments (+32.9%)** |
| **DHL** | 5,008 | **44.8%** | ⬇️ **-1,523 shipments (-23.3%)** |

**Opportunity Summary**:
- **ACI could gain**: 1,629 shipments from DHL (currently using DHL for ACI-eligible ZIPs)
- **ACI retains**: 4,528 of current volume
- **New split**: ACI 55.1% / DHL 44.8%

### Detailed Findings

#### Current ACI Volume Impact
**Current ACI**: 4,634 shipments
- ✅ **Can stay with ACI**: 4,528 (97.7%)
- ❌ **Must move to DHL**: 106 (2.3%)

**Service breakdown of forced moves (106 shipments)**:
- Expedited: 66 shipments (62.3%)
- Ground: 40 shipments (37.7%)

#### Current DHL Volume Opportunity
**Current DHL**: 6,531 shipments
- 🔄 **Could move to ACI**: 1,629 (24.9%)
- ⚠️ **Stays with DHL**: 4,902 (75.1%) - destinations NOT in Xparcel ZIP limits

### Key Business Insights

1. **Minimal Loss Risk**: Only 2.3% of current ACI volume is at risk due to ZIP limits

2. **Strong Retention**: ACI retains 97.7% of current volume (4,528 shipments)

3. **Growth Opportunity**: 1,629 DHL shipments currently going to ACI-eligible ZIPs could consolidate to ACI

4. **DHL Need Persists**: 4,902 shipments (75% of current DHL volume) go to destinations NOT covered by Xparcel from origin 761
   - These require alternative network coverage (National Network or alternative carrier)

### Strategic Implications

**The ZIP limits will cause minimal disruption**:
- ACI volume drops only 1.0 percentage points (41.5% → 40.5%)
- 106 shipments is a small fraction of total volume
- Strong foundation for Xparcel service from origin 761

**Opportunity for consolidation**:
- If BoxiiShip prioritizes ACI for eligible destinations, volume could shift from 41.5% → 55.1%
- Would require business decision to prefer ACI over DHL for the 1,629 eligible shipments

**Dual-carrier reality**:
- 44.4% of total volume (4,963 shipments) goes to non-Xparcel ZIPs
- BoxiiShip will likely continue using both carriers
- DHL serves destinations outside Xparcel Select Network coverage

- `zip_limit_volume_shift_analysis.py` - Volume shift scenarios and projections
