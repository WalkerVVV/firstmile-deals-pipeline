Hi Josh,

I've completed the full analysis on your 6-month shipping data (175K shipments) and the FirstMile Xparcel opportunity is solid.

**Key Results:**
- 12% average savings: **$24,100/month** ($289K annually)
- Your average cost per package drops from $7.22 to $6.35
- 46% of your volume is under 1 lb - perfect for our lightweight pricing

**Why This Works for Josh's Frogs:**
Your shipping profile is ideal for FirstMile's dynamic routing. We consolidate your current 3-carrier mix (62% USPS, 24% FedEx, 10% UPS) into our National + Select networks, giving you:
- Single integration (one connection for all ground services)
- Audit Queue (blocks mis-rated labels before they hit your invoice)
- Single support thread (no more juggling carrier contacts for claims/returns)

**Next Step:**
Let's schedule 15-20 minutes this week to walk through the attached analysis.

**What works for you?**
- Tuesday 10/15: 10 AM or 2 PM MST
- Wednesday 10/16: 9 AM or 3 PM MST
- Thursday 10/17: 11 AM or 1 PM MST

I've attached the professional 6-tab analysis showing the breakdown by weight, zone, and current carrier.
