## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### Chrome MCP Integration Success ✅
**What Worked**:
- Configuration fix (`transport` → `type: streamableHttp`) was simple
- Superhuman email now accessible in real-time
- 34 browser tabs visible to Claude
- Email action items extracted automatically

**Impact**: This is a game-changer for workflow efficiency. Can now scan email inbox as part of 9AM sync without manual copy/paste.

### Email + Call Combination Strategy
**Approach**:
- Send email first (documentation trail)
- Follow with phone call immediately (shows urgency)
- Log both activities in HubSpot (complete record)

**Why This Works**:
- Email provides written reference
- Call shows personal commitment
- Increases response likelihood
- Creates complete audit trail

### DHL Conflict Management
**Lesson**: When partner conflicts arise (DHL asking to disengage), address directly with customer to clarify relationship. Don't assume - ask for data.

**Approach**:
- Stated the facts (DHL message received)
- Referenced data (only 6 expedited shipments)
- Explained partnership dynamics (they back off if we're working with account)
- Asked direct question: "What's the story?"
