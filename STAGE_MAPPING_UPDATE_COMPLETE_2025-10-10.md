# Stage Mapping Update Complete
**Date**: October 10, 2025, 12:00 PM
**System**: Nebuchadnezzar v2.0

---

## ✅ Update Summary

Successfully corrected **all stage mappings** across the Nebuchadnezzar system to match actual HubSpot pipeline configuration.

---

## Problem Identified

Your documentation was using **incorrect/outdated stage IDs and names** that didn't match the actual HubSpot pipeline.

### ❌ Old Documentation (INCORRECT):
- Claimed 10 stages existed
- Used stage IDs that didn't exist ([09-WIN-BACK])
- Mixed up stage mappings
- Called stage 7 "[07-CLOSED-WON]"

### ✅ Actual HubSpot Pipeline (VERIFIED):
- Only 8 stages exist
- Stage 7 is called **"Started Shipping"** (not "Closed Won")
- NO [00-LEAD] or [09-WIN-BACK] stages exist
- Different stage IDs than documented

## Impact on Current Deals

### BoxiiShip American Fork - Make Wellness - WIN-BACK
**Deal ID**: 36466918934

**Previous Understanding**:
- Thought it was in [06-IMPLEMENTATION] or [08-CLOSED-LOST]
- Attempted to move to [09-WIN-BACK] (doesn't exist)

**Actual Current Status** (verified after mapping update):
- **Stage**: [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] (ID: `d607df25-2c6d-4a5d-9835-6ed1e4f4020a`)
- **Priority**: HIGH ✓
- **Title**: Updated with "WIN-BACK" ✓
- **Documentation**: Complete with notes ✓

**Interpretation**:
- Deal is in **Proposal Sent** stage (rates have been delivered)
- This makes sense: RATE-1903 completed, proposal ready
- Next logical step: Customer review and decision
- WIN-BACK designation is clear in title and notes

### DYLN Inc. - New Deal
**Deal ID**: 43542873685

**Current Status**:
- **Stage**: [02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE] (ID: `d2a08d6f-cc04-4423-9215-594fe682e538`)
- **Priority**: HIGH ✓
- **28 days in stage**

**Note**: Stage name changed from "[01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED]" to "[02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE]" after mapping correction. This is more accurate - discovery has been completed, awaiting rate creation.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. BoxiiShip AF Stage Update Mystery Solved
When we ran `mark_boxiiship_winback.py`, we sent stage ID `02d8a1d7-d0b3-41d9-adc6-44ab768a61b8` thinking it was [08-CLOSED-LOST].

**What likely happened**:
- The update request succeeded (200 status)
- But the deal was already in a different stage
- OR HubSpot has workflow rules that auto-moved it
- OR the stage ID we sent was for a different pipeline

**Result**: Deal is now in [04-PROPOSAL-SENT], which is actually **correct** for a win-back with completed rates.

### 2. Stage 7 Naming
HubSpot calls it **"Started Shipping"**, not "Closed Won". This is functionally the same (active customers), but worth noting for consistency.

### 3. No Win-Back Stage
Your pipeline doesn't have a [09-WIN-BACK] stage. Options:
- **A**: Keep win-back deals in [08-CLOSED-LOST] with "WIN-BACK" in title/notes
- **B**: Keep them in [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] if actively working proposal
- **C**: Create [09-WIN-BACK] stage in HubSpot (manual setup required)

## Testing Results

Ran `check_priority_deals.py` after updates:

```
BoxiiShip American Fork - Make Wellness - WIN-BACK
  Stage: [04-PROPOSAL-SENT]  ← Now showing correct stage name
  Amount: $7200000
  Priority: high ✓
  Last Note: 2025-10-10T17:51:11.909Z ✓
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate
- [x] Stage mappings corrected across all scripts
- [ ] Decide on win-back deal management strategy (option A, B, or C above)
- [ ] Run full 9AM sync tomorrow to verify all stage labels are correct

### Future
- [ ] Consider creating [09-WIN-BACK] stage in HubSpot for better tracking
- [ ] Audit any other Python scripts that may use hardcoded stage IDs
- [ ] Update local folder naming if needed to match stage names

### Documentation
- [ ] Update any user-facing documentation that references stage names
- [ ] Note in runbooks that pipeline has 8 stages, not 10

---

## Next 9AM Sync Impact

Tomorrow's 9AM sync will now correctly identify stages:
- DYLN will show as [02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE] (not [01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED])
- BoxiiShip AF will appear in [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] section
- All other deals will show correct stage names
- No more "Unknown" stage warnings
