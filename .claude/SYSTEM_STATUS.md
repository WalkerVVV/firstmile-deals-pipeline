---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFICATION NEEDED

### 1. Pipeline Stage IDs - CONFLICT RESOLUTION REQUIRED

**Issue**: Two sources show different IDs for the same stages

#### Stage [03] Rate Creation - TWO POSSIBLE IDs:
```yaml
Source 1 (HubSpot MCP Integration):
  [03] Rate Creation: e1c4321e-afb6-4b29-97d4-2b2425488535

Source 2 (pipeline_sync_verification.py):
  [03-RATE-CREATION]: 1090865183
```

**Action Required**:
- Test both IDs in HubSpot API
- Determine which is current/correct
- Update NEBUCHADNEZZAR_REFERENCE.md with verified ID

#### Stage [06] Implementation - MISSING ID:
```yaml
[06-IMPLEMENTATION]: NOT FOUND in either source
```

**Action Required**:
- Query HubSpot API for [06] stage ID
- Add to NEBUCHADNEZZAR_REFERENCE.md

### 2. Stage Numbering Discrepancy

**Issue**: Different numbering schemes between sources

```yaml
HubSpot MCP shows:
  [00/01] Lead: 08d9c411-5e1b-487b-8732-9c2bcbbd0307
  [02] Discovery: d2a08d6f-cc04-4423-9215-594fe682e538
  [03] Rate Creation: e1c4321e-afb6-4b29-97d4-2b2425488535

pipeline_sync_verification.py shows:
  [01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED]: d2a08d6f-cc04-4423-9215-594fe682e538  # Same as [02]
  [02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE]: e1c4321e-afb6-4b29-97d4-2b2425488535  # Same as [03]
```

**Hypothesis**: Pipeline stages may have been renumbered or renamed in HubSpot

**Action Required**:
- Export current pipeline stages from HubSpot
- Create authoritative stage ID mapping
- Update all documentation with verified IDs

### 3. HubSpot MCP Server Configuration

**Status**: Configuration file created but connection not verified

**Current State**:
```json
// .claude/.claude.json created with:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hubspot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@hubspot/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HUBSPOT_API_KEY": "pat-na1-3044b6ba-1d68-4ad0-9bca-de8904bb0764",
        "HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID": "46526832"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Action Required**:
1. Run `claude mcp list` to verify connection
2. If still failing, check MCP configuration location
3. Test HubSpot MCP tools once connected
4. Document available tools in HUBSPOT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md

### 4. Python Scripts vs MCP Tools

**Current Confusion**:
- Documentation mentions `qm hubspot` commands
- These appear to be Python scripts, NOT MCP tools
- Need clarification on which system to use

**Action Required**:
1. Identify if `qm hubspot` commands are:
   - Python scripts calling HubSpot API directly
   - MCP tool wrappers
   - Custom CLI tool
2. Document the relationship between:
   - `qm hubspot` commands
   - HubSpot MCP tools
   - Direct Python API scripts
3. Update workflows to use correct tools

---

## üìã VERIFICATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Verify HubSpot API Access
```bash
# Test direct API access
curl -X GET "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/pipelines/deals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pat-na1-3044b6ba-1d68-4ad0-9bca-de8904bb0764"
```

Expected: JSON response with pipeline details including all stage IDs

### Step 2: Extract Verified Stage IDs
```bash
# Parse response to get stage IDs and names
# Match against documented stage names
# Resolve conflicts
```

### Step 3: Update NEBUCHADNEZZAR_REFERENCE.md
```yaml
# Replace conflicted sections with verified IDs
# Add [06] Implementation ID
# Remove "TBD" and "CONFLICT" markers
```

### Step 4: Test HubSpot MCP
```bash
# Verify MCP server connection
claude mcp list

# If connected, test tools
# Document available tools
```

### Step 5: Update Daily Sync Flows
```bash
# Ensure all syncs use verified stage IDs
# Test sync prompts with real HubSpot data
# Validate context loading works
```

## üìù DOCUMENTATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ Complete & Current
- [x] INDEX.md - Central navigation
- [x] DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md - Master guide
- [x] DAILY_SYNC_FLOWS_V3.md - v3.0 sync prompts
- [x] DEAL_FOLDER_TEMPLATE.md - Standard structure
- [x] FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md - Organization guide

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Verification/Update
- [ ] NEBUCHADNEZZAR_REFERENCE.md - Stage ID conflicts
- [ ] HUBSPOT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md - MCP tools documentation
- [ ] DAILY_SYNC_OPERATIONS.md - May need v3.0 updates

### üîÑ Legacy/Historical
- README.md - Complete but may need stage ID updates
- WORKBOOK_BLUEPRINT (1).md - Historical reference

---

## üöÄ NEXT ACTIONS (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Resolve Stage ID Conflicts
1. Query HubSpot API for current pipeline stages
2. Match stage names to IDs
3. Identify correct ID for [03] Rate Creation
4. Find missing ID for [06] Implementation
5. Update NEBUCHADNEZZAR_REFERENCE.md with verified IDs

### Priority 2: Verify HubSpot MCP Connection
1. Check MCP server status: `claude mcp list`
2. If not connected, troubleshoot configuration
3. Once connected, document available MCP tools
4. Update HUBSPOT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md

### Priority 3: Test Daily Sync Flows v3.0
1. Run `;9am` sync with real pipeline data
2. Verify context loading from EOD works
3. Test owner/pipeline locks filter correctly
4. Validate all 5 syncs (9am, noon, 3pm, eod, weekly)

### Priority 4: Memory System Integration
1. Test memory capture during EOD sync
2. Verify memory retrieval during 9AM sync
3. Document memory naming conventions in use
4. Archive sample learnings to demonstrate system

---

## üîß TECHNICAL DEBT

### Known Issues
1. **Stage ID Mapping**: Two sources with conflicting IDs
2. **MCP vs Scripts**: Unclear which system to use for HubSpot operations
3. **Association IDs**: New IDs found, legacy IDs documented - need reconciliation
4. **TextExpander Setup**: Prompts created but not yet loaded into TextExpander

### Future Enhancements
1. Automated stage ID validation script
2. MCP health check in daily sync
3. Memory system automation for EOD
4. Weekly sync to Saner.ai integration

---

## üìä SYSTEM HEALTH

### Current State
- **Documentation**: 90% complete, 10% needs verification
- **HubSpot Integration**: API key provided, MCP status unknown
- **Daily Sync Flows**: v3.0 created, not yet tested
- **Pipeline Tracking**: Stage IDs need verification

### Blockers
1. Stage ID conflicts prevent full automation confidence
2. HubSpot MCP connection status unknown
3. `qm hubspot` command system unclear

### Green Lights
- ‚úÖ Documentation centralized and organized
- ‚úÖ Owner/pipeline locks identified and applied
- ‚úÖ Continuous improvement schema designed
- ‚úÖ Context loading workflow documented
