## Slide 8: Conservative Savings Projection

Current State vs FirstMile Xparcel:
- Monthly Packages: [X,XXX] → [X,XXX]
- Daily Volume: ~[XXX] → ~[XXX]
- Average Cost/Package: $[X.XX] → $[X.XX - X.XX]
- Monthly Spend: $[XX,XXX] → $[XX,XXX - XX,XXX]
- Monthly Savings: — → $[X,XXX - XX,XXX]
- Annual Savings: — → $[XX,XXX - XXX,XXX]
- Cost Reduction %: — → [X% - XX%]

Conservative Approach:
These projections are deliberately conservative. We need to verify [Current Carrier] rate accuracy in your system export. If your actual costs are higher than the data shows, our savings opportunity could be substantially greater.

## Slide 9: Where FirstMile Shines
Perfect Weight Profile:
[X%] under 1 lb is our sweet spot. Traditional carriers overprice lightweight packages — we deliver maximum value.

Zone Distribution Advantage:
[X%] of volume in zones 4-7 is ideal for our expanded network. Zone-skipping provides biggest impact in far zones.

Service Mix Simplicity:
[X%] Ground volume means we optimize the vast majority without complex service level requirements.

Strong Volume:
[X,XXX] packages/month (~[XXX]/day) provides stable operations and strong negotiating position for continued rate optimization.

## Slide 10: Service Advantages Beyond Cost
Cost savings are important, but FirstMile provides operational benefits traditional carriers don't:

Audit Queue: Catches mis-rated labels before they hit your invoice — typically prevents $500-$1,000/month in billing errors for a shipper your size

Single Support Thread: One FirstMile team handles claims, returns, exceptions, and billing. No bouncing between carrier reps. Average resolution: 4.2 hours vs 2-3 days industry average

Returns Portal: QR-code-based returns requiring no printing. Your customers love it, you get full visibility and analytics on return patterns

Claims Recovery: 94% success rate within 14 days. Industry average: 60-120 days with far lower recovery rates

For [Customer Type - e.g., 3PL, Brand, Retailer]:
Every dollar saved on shipping is a dollar that strengthens your service offering and improves [client/customer] satisfaction.

## Slide 11: Implementation Timeline
You're currently using [System Name] for order fulfillment and label generation. FirstMile integrates directly through their multi-carrier API.

Implementation Timeline:
Week 1: Contract signature, tech kickoff with [System]
Weeks 2-3: API integration dev and testing in sandbox
Week 4: Pilot launch with 20-30% volume
Weeks 5-12: Ramp to full volume with [Current Carrier] parallel
Week 13+: Ongoing optimization, quarterly reviews

What Stays the Same:
- Same thermal printers
- Same label stock
- Same warehouse workflow
- No team retraining needed

The complexity is invisible to you — you just see better rates and better service.

90-Day Pilot: Keep [Current Carrier] running in parallel. Track SLA compliance, customer satisfaction, and cost savings. Make the full switch only when you're confident.

## Slide 12: What Happens Next
