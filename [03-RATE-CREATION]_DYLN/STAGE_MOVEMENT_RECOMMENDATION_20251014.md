## Stage Movement Recommendation

### Move From: [01-QUALIFIED]

**Why Leave Qualified:**
- Discovery work is complete (volume analysis done)
- Customer requirements understood
- Initial rate card already created
- Now in active rate improvement process

### Move To: [03-RATE-CREATION]

**Why Rate Creation:**
- RATE-1907 is active rate improvement work
- Sales Pricing team actively working on improved rates
- This is rate creation phase, not discovery
- Waiting on deliverable from Sales Pricing team

### Do NOT Move To: [02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE]

**Why Skip:**
- Discovery is long past (July-September 2025)
- Already have rate card (just needs improvement)
- Moving to [02-DISCOVERY-COMPLETE] would be a step backwards

---

## Next Actions After Stage Movement

### Immediate (While in [03-RATE-CREATION])
1. **Monitor RATE-1907** ‚è≥
   - Check Jira daily for Sales Pricing response
   - Expected turnaround: 7-14 business days (submitted Oct 9)
   - Follow up with Sales Pricing if no update by October 21

2. **Prepare Proposal Materials** üìù
   - Draft proposal template ready for improved rates
   - Prepare comparison showing FirstMile vs USPS Tier 2 NSA
   - Highlight no volume minimums (vs USPS 25K quarterly requirement)

3. **HubSpot Update** üíº
   - Move deal to [03-RATE-CREATION] stage
   - Add note: "RATE-1907 submitted Oct 9, awaiting improved rates from Sales Pricing"
   - Set follow-up reminder for October 21 (rate improvement check-in)

### When Improved Rates Arrive
4. **Review and Validate** ‚úÖ
   - Analyze improved rate card
   - Compare to USPS Tier 2 NSA competitive pricing
   - Calculate savings vs neighbor's current USPS rates

5. **Create Competitive Proposal** üìä
   - Use improved rates in proposal
   - Emphasize FirstMile advantages:
     * No volume minimums (vs USPS 25K quarterly)
     * Direct carrier relationship (not reseller)
     * Audit Queue for billing accuracy
     * 3PL-focused support team
     * Unified pricing for both locations

6. **Schedule Follow-Up with Dorian Ayres** üìû
   - Present improved rates and proposal
   - Walk through savings analysis
   - Discuss implementation timeline
   - Move to [04-PROPOSAL-SENT] after presenting

## Competitive Context

### Current Competition
**Neighbor's USPS Tier 2 NSA:**
- Requires 25,000 shipments quarterly minimum
- Rigid volume commitments
- DYLN prefers DHL eCom over USPS for quality/reliability

### FirstMile Advantages to Emphasize
1. **No Volume Minimums** - Flexible growth without commitments
2. **Direct Carrier Relationship** - Not a reseller, true carrier
3. **Audit Queue** - Catch billing errors before invoice
4. **3PL Support** - Dedicated team understands 3PL operations
5. **Multi-Location Pricing** - Serve both DYLN and neighbor with unified rates
6. **Dynamic Routing** - ML-driven optimization for best cost/SLA balance

---

## Risk Assessment

### Moderate Risks
1. **Rate Improvement Timeline** ‚è≥
   - Sales Pricing may take longer than expected
   - Mitigation: Follow up October 21 if no update

2. **Competitive USPS Pricing** üí∞
   - Neighbor may have very competitive Tier 2 NSA rates
   - Mitigation: Emphasize non-price advantages (no minimums, quality, support)

3. **Multi-Location Complexity** üè¢
   - Coordinating pricing across two warehouses
   - Mitigation: Unified pricing structure simplifies

### Low Risks
4. **Volume Profile Mismatch** üì¶
   - DYLN (lightweight) + Neighbor (mid-weight) are both good fits
   - Mitigation: Already analyzed, both work well with Xparcel

5. **Integration Complexity** üîå
   - 3PLs typically have good integration capabilities
   - Mitigation: Standard 3PL onboarding process
