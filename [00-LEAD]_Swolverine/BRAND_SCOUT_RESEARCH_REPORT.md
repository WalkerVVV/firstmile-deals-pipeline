### 3PL Provider & Fulfillment Operations

**3PL Provider**: ❌ **NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSED**
**WMS Technology**: ❌ **NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSED**
**Warehouse Locations**: ❌ **NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSED**
**Fulfillment Scale**: ❌ **NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE**

**Corporate Mailing Address**: Reno, NV (actual fulfillment center location unknown)

**Research Findings**:
- No case studies found (unlike BURST Oral Care's ShipHero case study)
- No partnership announcements with ShipBob, ShipStation, or other major 3PLs
- No press releases about logistics providers
- LinkedIn shows warehouse manager roles but no specific 3PL partner named
- Company does not publicly disclose fulfillment partner details

**Confidence Level**: 🔍 **INFORMATION GAP** - This is private information not shared publicly

---

## Key Information Gaps

The following information could NOT be determined through public sources:

❌ **Missing Information**:
1. Specific 3PL provider name
2. WMS platform used (ShipStation? ShipHero? Custom?)
3. Physical warehouse/fulfillment center locations
4. Monthly shipment volumes
5. Phone numbers for decision makers
6. Current shipping costs and pain points
7. Contract status with current carriers

**Reason**: Swolverine has not published case studies, press releases, or partnership announcements related to their fulfillment operations. This information is kept private and would require direct discovery conversation.

## FirstMile Opportunity Analysis

### Current State Assessment

**Multi-Carrier Operations**: ✅ Already using multiple carriers (USPS, FedEx, DHL, UPS)
**Weight-Based Routing**: ✅ Already routing based on package weight (<1lb vs >1lb)
**Free Shipping Threshold**: $99+ (margin pressure opportunity)

### Opportunity Areas

#### 1. **Carrier Cost Optimization**
- **Current**: Using 4 different carriers with likely separate contracts
- **Opportunity**: Consolidate to FirstMile Xparcel with single invoice
- **Value Prop**: National + Select network coverage, single point of contact

#### 2. **Weight-Based Routing Optimization**
- **Current**: Simple <1lb = USPS, >1lb = FedEx/DHL/UPS
- **Opportunity**: Dynamic routing via FirstMile with zone-skipping
- **Value Prop**:
  - Xparcel Ground (3-8 day) for cost-sensitive orders
  - Xparcel Expedited (2-5 day) for mid-tier
  - Xparcel Priority (1-3 day) for premium

#### 3. **Reno, NV Location Advantage**
- **Strategic Location**: Reno is West Coast distribution hub
- **Opportunity**: FirstMile Select network injection points (LA, DAL, ATL, ORD, EWR)
- **Value Prop**: Zone-skipping for faster transit to major metros

#### 4. **Supplement Industry Specific**
- **Industry**: Nutraceuticals (recurring revenue model)
- **Profile**: Regular repeat customers, predictable volume
- **Value Prop**:
  - Audit Queue (blocks mis-rated labels before invoice)
  - Claims & Returns single support thread
  - Unified platform for all services

#### 5. **Free Shipping Threshold Pressure**
- **Current**: $99+ free shipping (margin pressure)
- **Opportunity**: Reduce per-package shipping costs to lower threshold or improve margins
- **Value Prop**: Cost savings enable competitive free shipping or increased profitability

- [ ] Open contract or renewal opportunity within 90 days
- [ ] Decision-making authority identified (likely Walter or Alexandria)

## Competitive Intelligence

### Likely Current Provider Patterns
**Based on multi-carrier usage and Reno location**:
- Possible 3PL partners: ShipBob (Reno warehouse), ShipStation (software), Deliverr/Flexport
- Likely managing carrier contracts directly (USPS, FedEx, DHL, UPS)
- Probable use of multi-carrier shipping software (ShipStation, EasyShip, ShippingEasy)

### Differentiation Points for FirstMile
1. **Single Carrier Simplicity** vs. managing 4 separate carrier relationships
2. **Audit Queue** vs. reactive invoice disputes
3. **White Glove Support** vs. separate support tickets per carrier
4. **Dynamic Routing** vs. manual carrier selection rules
5. **Zone-Skipping Network** vs. standard carrier routing
