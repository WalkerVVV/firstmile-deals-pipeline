Subject: Josh's Frogs - Dry Goods Shipping Analysis (139K+ Monthly Volume)

Hey Josh,

Quick update on your custom Xparcel rates - I've completed the analysis focusing specifically on your dry goods shipping (feed, supplies, accessories, etc.) and the numbers look very strong.

With your 139K+ monthly dry goods volume, we're seeing significant savings opportunities:

• **~$339K/month savings potential** (~$4.1M annually)
• **35% average savings** across all dry goods services
• **Cost per package drops from $6.88 to $4.44**

Your current carrier mix breaks down as:
• USPS Ground Advantage: 71.6% (99,675 pkgs)
• UPS/FedEx Ground: 23.6% (32,827 pkgs)
• USPS Priority/DHL: 4.8% (6,742 pkgs)

The biggest savings opportunities are on your UPS/FedEx Ground volume (50-55% savings) while maintaining competitive rates on the USPS Ground Advantage shipments (20-25% improvement).

*Note: This analysis excludes your express/overnight services for live animals - we should discuss those separately with temperature-controlled routing considerations.*

Can we schedule a quick 15-min call this week to walk through the detailed breakdown?

Best,
Brett
