## Contact History

### Planned Outreach (Not Yet Executed)

#### LinkedIn Outreach - Walter Hinchman
**Target Date**: November 13, 2025 (Today)
**Approach**: Personalized connection request
**Message Template**:
```
Hi Walter,

I noticed your impressive work building Swolverine into a respected brand in the supplements space. With your Reno location and multi-carrier shipping operations, I thought you might be interested in learning how FirstMile is helping nutraceutical brands consolidate carriers and reduce shipping costs.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation about your current fulfillment setup?

Best regards,
Brett Walker
FirstMile
```

#### Email Outreach - Walter Hinchman
**Target Date**: November 15, 2025 (Day 2)
**Subject**: "Reno-based shipping solution for Swolverine supplements"
**Approach**: Brief value proposition with discovery call CTA

**Email Template**:
```
Hi Walter,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I noticed Swolverine is managing multiple shipping carriers (USPS, FedEx, DHL, UPS) for your supplement fulfillment.

Many nutraceutical brands in your situation have found significant value in consolidating to a single carrier with dynamic routing:

• 15-30% cost savings through zone-skipping and optimized routing
• Single invoice instead of managing 4 separate carrier relationships
• Audit Queue that blocks mis-rated labels before invoices hit A/P
• White glove support for claims, returns, and exceptions

Given your Reno location and West Coast distribution advantage, I'd love to share how FirstMile's Xparcel services (Ground, Expedited, Priority) could fit your operations.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute discovery call next week?

Best regards,
Brett Walker
Business Development
FirstMile

## Discovery Notes

### Key Questions for Discovery Call

**Volume & Operations**:
- What's your average monthly shipment volume?
- What's your typical weight distribution? (We saw <1lb goes USPS)
- Who is your current 3PL provider?
- What WMS/shipping software are you using?

**Pain Points**:
- What are your biggest challenges with current shipping operations?
- How do you handle carrier invoice audits?
- Any issues with claims or returns processing?
- How satisfied are you with current carrier service levels?

**Decision Making**:
- When do your current carrier contracts come up for renewal?
- What's your decision-making process for changing carriers?
- Who else would need to be involved in this evaluation?
- What would make this a priority for you this quarter?

**Financial**:
- Ballpark annual shipping spend?
- What would meaningful cost savings look like?
- Any budget allocated for carrier/3PL evaluation?

## Opportunity Assessment

### Fit Score: **B+ (Strong)**

**Why Good Fit**:
✅ Multi-carrier operations (consolidation opportunity)
✅ Weight-based routing sophistication (operationally mature)
✅ Reno location (FirstMile network advantage)
✅ Supplement industry (recurring revenue, predictable volume)
✅ Free shipping threshold (margin pressure, cost savings matter)
✅ Strong decision maker access (CEO/COO both identified)

**Potential Challenges**:
❌ Unknown monthly volume (could be below 1,000 packages/month minimum)
❌ No visibility into current contracts (could have long-term lock-in)
❌ 3PL provider unknown (may be embedded in 3PL contract)
❌ No known pain points yet (discovery required)

### Value Proposition for Swolverine

**Primary Pitch**: "Single carrier simplicity with multi-carrier performance"

**Key Benefits**:
1. **Cost Savings**: 15-30% reduction through zone-skipping and optimized routing
2. **Operational Simplicity**: One carrier, one invoice, one support team vs. 4 separate relationships
3. **Audit Queue**: Catch rating errors BEFORE invoice hits A/P (saves time and money)
4. **Reno Advantage**: West Coast Select network injection points (LA, DAL, ATL, ORD, EWR)
5. **Service Flexibility**: 3 service levels (Ground 3-8d, Expedited 2-5d, Priority 1-3d)

**Differentiation from Current Setup**:
- **vs. USPS**: Better tracking, faster transit, zone-skipping
- **vs. FedEx/UPS**: Lower costs, same or better service levels
- **vs. DHL**: Domestic focus, better support
- **vs. All**: Single platform, audit protection, white glove support
