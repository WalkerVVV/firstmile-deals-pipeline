## System Observations & Recommendations

### Issues Identified

1. **Automated Sync Scope Limitation**:
   - 9AM sync only queries priority stages: [01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED] through [05-SETUP-DOCS-SENT]
   - Excludes [06-IMPLEMENTATION], [07-CLOSED-WON], [08-CLOSED-LOST], [09-WIN-BACK]
   - **Result**: $7.1M BoxiiShip win-back opportunity not flagged

2. **Stage Mapping Inconsistency**:
   - Local folder naming may use old conventions (`[01-QUALIFIED]`)
   - HubSpot uses standardized naming (`[01-DISCOVERY-SCHEDULED]`)
   - **Result**: Potential confusion when moving deals between systems

3. **Manual Updates Not Integrated**:
   - Yesterday's comprehensive updates exist in HubSpot notes
   - Not surfaced in automated morning sync
   - **Result**: Risk of losing track of recent critical updates

### Recommendations

1. **Expand 9AM Sync Scope**:
   - Include [06-IMPLEMENTATION] for active onboarding tracking
   - Include [08-CLOSED-LOST] for win-back opportunity monitoring
   - Include [09-WIN-BACK] for re-engagement campaigns

2. **Add "Recent Updates" Section to Sync**:
   - Query deals with notes updated in last 24-48 hours
   - Surface manual updates regardless of stage
   - Prevent high-value opportunities from falling through cracks

3. **Standardize Folder Naming**:
   - Audit all local deal folders
   - Rename to match current HubSpot stage conventions
   - Update automation to handle legacy folder names

4. **Create Daily Reconciliation Workflow**:
   - Compare automated sync results with manual updates
   - Flag stage mismatches for human review
   - Generate combined priority list
