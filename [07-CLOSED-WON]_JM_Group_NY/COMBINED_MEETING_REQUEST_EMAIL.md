## EMAIL BODY

Yehoshua and Daniel,

Pickups were cancelled October 6. I understand why—your marketplace metrics are too close to thresholds, and protecting your Amazon/Walmart accounts is more important than any cost savings.

**I've analyzed your data and identified the problem:**

I reviewed all 3,866 shipments from Aug 17-Sep 30. Here's what I found:
- 602 shipments (15.6% of volume) through ACI services average 4.15-4.35 days—your highest-risk segment
- 1,004 shipments (28.5%) deliver on Day 4—zero buffer for marketplace promises
- 912 shipments (26%) take 5+ days—these are triggering your marketplace concerns

**I have a data-driven fix ready:**

Shift your 602 ACI shipments to Expedited service. Expected result:
- 85%+ deliver within 4 days (currently 74%)
- 95%+ deliver within 5 days (currently 88%)
- <2% late shipment rate (well below Amazon's 4% threshold)
- Walmart on-time rate: 92.8% → 95%+

**But I need your help to optimize it correctly:**

Before we meet, I need to understand the exact marketplace performance calculations to properly configure your Xparcel setup. I've prepared 8 specific questions that will help me:

1. Map marketplace shipping promises to correct Xparcel service levels
2. Configure ShipStation automation rules for intelligent routing
3. Identify exact root causes of late deliveries
4. Create proactive alerts before packages risk being late

**Key questions I need answered:**
- How does Amazon define "Late Shipment" vs. "On-Time Delivery"?
- What are the promised delivery windows by shipping speed? (Standard, Expedited, Two-Day)
- Can you share 10-20 tracking numbers Amazon/Walmart flagged as late?
- What's your current ShipStation automation setup?

**Attached**: Full questionnaire (8 questions with detailed explanations)

**Can we meet this week to review your answers and implement the fix?**

**My availability:**
- Monday: 2pm-5pm MDT
- Tuesday: 10am-12pm or 2pm-5pm MDT
- Wednesday: 9am-5pm MDT

30-45 minutes. Your office (2691 West 15th St, Brooklyn) or video call—whatever works best for you.

If you can review the attached questionnaire before our meeting, we can make our time together much more actionable. But if you'd rather discuss these questions live, that works too.

I want to earn back your trust and protect your marketplace accounts.

Best,

Brett Walker

## ALTERNATIVE VERSION (SHORTER)

**Subject**: JM Group - Let's Fix Your Marketplace Metrics This Week

Yehoshua and Daniel,

Pickups were cancelled October 6. I understand why—marketplace metrics too close to thresholds.

**The Problem (From Your Data):**
- 602 shipments (15.6%) through ACI services average 4.15-4.35 days—highest risk
- 28.5% deliver on Day 4—zero buffer for marketplace promises
- Walmart at 92.8%, Amazon Account 2 at 94.84%—dangerously close to 90% threshold

**The Fix:**
Shift 602 ACI shipments to Expedited. Expected result: 85%+ within 4 days, 95%+ within 5 days, <2% late shipment rate.

**I Need Your Help:**
To optimize this correctly, I need to understand how Amazon and Walmart calculate your metrics. I've attached 8 questions that will help me configure your Xparcel setup properly.

**Key questions:**
- How do Amazon/Walmart define "late shipment" and "on-time delivery"?
- What are the promised delivery windows by shipping speed?
- Can you share 10-20 tracking numbers they flagged as late?
- What's your current ShipStation setup?

**Can we meet this week?**
Mon 2pm-5pm | Tue 10am-12pm or 2pm-5pm | Wed 9am-5pm (MDT)

30-45 minutes. Your office or video call.

Review the attached questions before our meeting if possible—it'll make our discussion more actionable.
