## Email Body

Hi Landon,

Following up on our recent discussions, I've completed a comprehensive analysis of Stackd Logistics' shipping data using FirstMile's Xparcel rates. The results show **$83,547 in annual savings (9.5%)** on your DHL eCommerce ground volume.

### Key Findings:

**Select Network Performance (Major Metros)**
- **15.7% savings** on 53% of your volume shipping to CA, TX, FL, NY, WA
- These are your highest-volume destinations where FirstMile's metro injection points deliver maximum value
- 8,992 packages/month addressable with superior economics
- **$6,004/month savings** ($72,046 annually)

**National Network (All Other States)**
- **2.7% savings** on remaining 47% of volume
- Still cost-competitive while maintaining nationwide coverage
- 7,844 packages/month with reliable service
- **$958/month savings** ($11,501 annually)

**Honest Assessment Approach**
I've broken down exactly where FirstMile excels (Select Network metros) and where we're competitive but not dominant (National Network). This transparency helps you make an informed decision and sets realistic expectations.

**What We Excluded**
Your UPS 2nd Day Air volume is **not included** in this analysis. That's a guaranteed service, while Xparcel is non-guaranteed ground. We're competing against your DHL eCommerce ground spend where we can deliver real value.

**Simplified Implementation**
- Your ShipHero integration is **already connected** - no additional platform work needed
- We just need to create FirstMile credentials during account setup (7-10 days from form submission)
- No pilot phase required - we can go straight to performance review cadence

### Total Opportunity:
- **16,836 packages/month** addressable volume (202,032 annually)
- **$83,547 annual savings** at current volume
- **9.5% overall savings** vs DHL baseline
- **$0.41 savings per package** average

### Next Step:

Let's schedule a **30-minute call this week** to walk through the attached Excel analysis together. I can answer any questions about the network breakdown, implementation timeline, or performance expectations.

**What works for you?**
- Tuesday 10/15: 10 AM or 2 PM MST
- Wednesday 10/16: 9 AM or 3 PM MST
- Thursday 10/17: 11 AM or 1 PM MST

The full analysis is attached with detailed breakdowns across 6 tabs:
1. **Executive Summary** - $83,547 annual savings opportunity
2. **FirstMile Advantages** - Dynamic routing, audit queue, unified support
3. **Weight Analysis** - Your lightweight profile (89% under 1 lb)
4. **Zone Analysis** - Regional vs cross-country split
5. **Rate Comparison** - Package-by-package DHL vs FirstMile
6. **Implementation Plan** - 4-phase timeline (7-10 days to first shipments)

Looking forward to connecting this week.

Best regards,
**Brett Walker**

## Key Talking Points (If Call Happens)

1. **Volume Clarification:**
   - "We analyzed your 2-week shipment data and extrapolated to monthly volume of ~16,836 packages"
   - "This represents approximately 202K packages annually, or ~$883K in current DHL spend"

2. **Select Network Advantage:**
   - "Your top 5 states (CA, TX, FL, NY, WA) represent 53% of volume - perfect fit for our Select Network injection points"
   - "$72,046 annual savings just from Select Network metros alone (15.7%)"
   - "National Network adds another $11,501 in savings (2.7%)"

3. **Honest Positioning:**
   - "National Network at 2.7% savings isn't a huge win, but it maintains consistency across your entire fulfillment footprint"
   - "We're not trying to oversell - just showing you where FirstMile delivers real value"
   - "The 9.5% blended savings is driven primarily by Select Network performance"

4. **Implementation Simplicity:**
   - "ShipHero already connected means we're 80% there"
   - "7-10 days from paperwork to first shipments"
   - "Weekly TouchBase meetings first month, then bi-monthly check-ins"

5. **Scope Clarity:**
   - "Intentionally excluded UPS 2nd Day Air - that's a guaranteed product we can't match with non-guaranteed Xparcel"
   - "Focused on your ~16,836 DHL ground packages per month where we can compete directly"

6. **Performance Expectations:**
   - "3-8 day SLA for Xparcel Ground"
   - "Dynamic routing optimizes for both speed and cost"
   - "Audit Queue prevents billing errors before invoice hits your AP"

7. **Average Cost per Package:**
   - "You're currently paying $4.37/package average with DHL"
   - "FirstMile brings that down to $3.96/package"
   - "$0.41 savings per package × 16,836 monthly volume = $6,962/month"
