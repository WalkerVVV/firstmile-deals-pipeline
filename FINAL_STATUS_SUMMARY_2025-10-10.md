## üìà Tomorrow's 9AM Sync Preview

- All 31 priority deals with correct stage names
- Updated urgency scores and follow-up triggers

**Won't Show** (needs manual tracking):
- [07] Started Shipping deals (like BoxiiShip customer deal)
- Customer expansion/win-back campaigns within customer folders

**Recommendation**: Expand 9AM sync to include [06-IMPLEMENTATION] and [07-STARTED-SHIPPING] stages.

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Win-Back Distinction**:
   - Active customer losing volume = subfolder in customer folder
   - Former customer re-engagement = NEW DEAL in [09-WIN-BACK] pipeline folder

2. **Stage Mapping**:
   - Always verify with HubSpot API (`get_pipeline_stages.py`)
   - Don't trust outdated documentation
   - Stage labels may differ from expected names

3. **Folder Organization**:
   - `[CUSTOMER]_` prefix for all active customers
   - Pipeline folders are temporary (deal lifecycle)
   - Customer folders are permanent (relationship lifecycle)

4. **Documentation Accuracy**:
   - Verify assumptions before making changes
   - Business context matters (3PL vs direct customer)
   - Always clarify deal relationships
