## Email Content

Javier, Ely, and Peter,

I'm reaching out to check on **Tactical Logistics** reactivation status and see where we stand on resolving the technical issues from earlier this year.

## Quick Timeline Recap

- **November 2024**: Peter referred Tactical Logistics, onboarding began
- **December 16, 2024**: First successful live label generation
- **Jan-Feb 2025**: Service interruptions due to technical issues
- **Feb-Mar 2025**: Shipping stopped due to unresolved API/compliance issues

## Outstanding Issues (From March 2025)

Based on the last communications, we had several blockers:

1. **API Integration Issues**:
   - Rate fetching errors
   - Label printing inconsistencies
   - Missing commercial invoices on international shipments

2. **International Rates**:
   - No international rates loaded for Tactical Logistics
   - Causing shipment processing failures

3. **Platform Compliance**:
   - Amazon and marketplace warnings
   - Documentation generation/transmission issues

## Status Check - October 2025

**Key Questions**:

1. **Resolution Status**: Have the API and rate loading issues been resolved on FirstMile's side?
2. **Tactical's Interest**: Is Joseph (Tactical Logistics) still interested in reactivating?
3. **Timeline**: If yes, what's the target restart date?
4. **Integration Changes**: Do we need to rebuild the API connection or can we resume from the existing setup?
5. **Volume Projections**: What monthly volume are we expecting when they restart?

## My Goal

I want to:
- Confirm all technical blockers have been cleared
- Coordinate a clean reactivation plan with Tactical Logistics
- Ensure we don't repeat the Jan-Feb 2025 issues
- Get them back to successful shipping ASAP

## Tactical Logistics Contact Info (For My Reference)

- **Primary**: Joseph Ausch (joseph@tacticallogistic.com)
- **Other Contacts**: Ephraim (ephraim@tacticallogistic.com), Claudia (claudia@tacticallogistic.com)
- **Location**: 18740 Harvill Avenue, Perris, CA 92570

## Next Steps

Let me know the current status and if there's anything I can do on the sales/account management side to help get them back online. Happy to:
- Join a coordination call with Tactical Logistics
- Review updated rates/setup with Joseph's team
- Help with any documentation or compliance requirements

Thanks for the partnership on this!
